experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a\par
wing in a slipstream .\par
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was\par
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift\par
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing\par
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the\par
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different\par
theoretical treatments of this problem .\par
  the comparative span loading curves, together with\par
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment\par
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or\par
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift\par
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree\par
well with a potential flow theory .\par
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for\par
the specific configuration of the experiment .\par

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small\par
viscosity .\par
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it\par
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the\par
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an\par
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary\par
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the\par
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat\par
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's\par
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is\par
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid\par
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of\par
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the\par
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small\par
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again\par
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature\par
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion\par
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .\par

roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a\par
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying\par
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .\par
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent\par
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins\par
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element\par
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)\par
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with\par
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer\par
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength\par
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the\par
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has\par
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the\par
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u\par
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of\par
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition\par
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds\par

  an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated\par
flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.\par
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .\par
  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition\par
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head\par
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-\par
layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was\par
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse\par
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the\par
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading\par
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a\par
uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .\par
  the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was\par
investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary\par
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .\par
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers\par
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was\par
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10\par
regardless of the amount of air injected .\par
  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis\par
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary\par
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .\par
  direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the\par
floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers\par
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air\par
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds\par
numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with\par
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction\par
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for\par

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the\par

  representative applications are described which illustrate the\par
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed\par
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of\par
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston\par
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by\par
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings\par
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing\par
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the\par
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and\par
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function\par
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the\par
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's\par
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic\par
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always\par
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .\par
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-\par
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section\par
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of\par
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .\par
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence\par
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that\par
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic\par
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on\par
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially\par
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by\par
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the\par
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .\par
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are\par
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic\par
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,\par
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification\par
of ackeret's formulas .\par
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the\par
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where\par
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of\par
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where\par
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions\par
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical\par
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-\par
thermoelastic interaction problems .\par

from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination\par

inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies .\par
  at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much\par
larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy\par
contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight\par
direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many\par
times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the\par
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly\par
analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave\par
found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison\par
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a\par
flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows\par
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this\par
similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution\par
is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a\par
hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel\par
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface\par
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity\par
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .\par
  energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the\par
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for\par
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,\par
where for a two-dimensional body and for a\par
body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not\par
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some\par
distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details\par
of the nose geometry .\par
  by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds\par
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures\par
generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures\par
induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface\par
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the\par

thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .\par
numerical results are presented for the transient temperature\par

set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a\par
set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion\par
of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation\par
allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner\par
analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass\par

down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to\par

significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on\par
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .\par
dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of\par
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions\par
of flight in the atmosphere .\par
  some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-\par
gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include\par
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied\par
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow\par
with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,\par
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or\par
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in\par
constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is\par
characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow\par
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent\par
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these\par
are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to\par

closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the\par
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary\par
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at\par
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the\par
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained\par
through numerical integration .\par
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic\par
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity\par
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic\par
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .\par
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to\par
be an important physical problem because of the high gas\par
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,\par
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .\par

a new technique for investigating heat transfer and\par

on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic\par
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid\par
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory\par
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,\par
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock\par
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .\par
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be\par
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other\par
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl\par
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the\par
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .\par

suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived\par

reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in\par

flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine\par
mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered\par
from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility .\par
if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it\par
vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due\par
to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce\par
propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness\par

contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but\par
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from\par
mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in\par
drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone\par
or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although\par
the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes\par
are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a\par
total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting\par
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape\par
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat-\par

analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .\par
  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-\par
aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for\par
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the\par
orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary\par
conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a\par
network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .\par
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by\par
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,\par
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships\par
in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for\par
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an\par
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .\par
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are\par
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step\par
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .\par
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of\par
square matrices composed independently for the different\par
transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively\par
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary\par
conditions .\par
  comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and\par
electric-analog solutions are favorable .\par

temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible\par
laminar boundary layer with arbitrary distribution\par
of surface temperature .\par
  an analysis is presented which enables the temperature\par
profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be\par
calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially\par
symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary\par
analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is\par
applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the\par
numerical results given herein have been computed for air .\par
the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant\par
surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco .\par
on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present\par
theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations\par
accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions\par
up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent\par
for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher\par
mach numbers .\par
  a particular effort has been made to present the results, which\par
are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used\par
readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point\par
of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic\par
distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is\par
necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be\par
approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final\par
equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the\par
work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends\par
entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface-\par
temperature distribution by a polynomial .\par
  an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the\par
principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown\par
that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer\par
coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative\par
heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the\par
customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown\par
to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface\par
temperature .  in the particular example considered, a\par
conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields\par
completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the\par
possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given .\par
in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal\par
equations developed are collected and summarized in the section\par

revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making\par
these comparisons, particular\par
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness\par
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this\par

investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary\par
layer in a compressible fluid .\par
  in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar\par
flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations .\par
the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .\par
  part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical\par
theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small\par
velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great\par
detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those\par
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances\par
have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions\par
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous\par
solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the\par
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first\par
approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is\par
greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic\par
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and\par
the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the\par
incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the\par
coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the\par
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .\par
  part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers .\par
the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown\par
that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient\par
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface\par
has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .\par
  a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the\par
gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the\par
rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid .\par
if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the\par
main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) .\par

a comparative analysis of the performance of long range\par
hypervelocity vehicles .\par
  long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their\par
motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in\par
unpowered flight .  powered flight is\par
analyzed for an idealized propulsion\par
system which rather closely approaches\par
present-day rocket motors .\par
unpowered flight is characterized by a return\par
to earth along a ballistic, skip,\par
or glide trajectory .  only those\par
trajectories are treated which yield the\par
maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight .\par
aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner\par
similar to that employed previously\par
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),\par
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is\par
considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .\par
  the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the\par
several types studied in the sense\par
that it generally requires the highest\par
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range .\par
this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat\par
transfer to the re-entry body through\par
the artifice of increasing pressure\par
drag in relation to friction drag - that\par
is, by using a blunt body .  thus\par
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight\par
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .\par
  the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood\par
of and greater than 4 is far superior\par
to the ballistic vehicle in ability\par
to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far\par
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage\par
that this heat can in the main be radiated\par
back to the atmosphere .\par
consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .\par
  the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is\par
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in\par
converting velocity into range .  at\par
lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to\par
be about equal to comparable ballistic\par
vehicles while at lift-drag ratios\par

mathematical model which is comprised\par
of a rigid power-plant system flexibly\par

asymmetries in the engine mount, propeller\par
speed, airspeed, mach number,\par
propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is found\par
to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system .\par
  with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability\par
boundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel\par
tests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoretical\par
results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends\par
as observed experimentally,. however,\par
for a given set of conditions\par
calculated airspeeds for neutral stability\par
are consistently lower than the\par

effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both\par
distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were\par
used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire\par
anemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the\par
three-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as\par
that previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical\par
value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,\par
the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was\par
found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds\par
when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including\par
density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the\par
roughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds\par
number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no\par
disturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface\par
cooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small\par
disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the\par
critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness\par
particles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the\par
boundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due\par
to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and\par
reynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the\par
boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar\par
stability derived from the surface cooling .\par

state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive\par
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the\par
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .\par
  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the\par
conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,\par
and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small\par
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high\par
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature\par
profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across\par
the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that\par
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed\par
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is\par
the only material parameter affecting this thickness .\par
  a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the\par

  as a result of studies made during the\par

international geophysical cooperation (igc),\par
it is known that a considerable fraction of\par
large solar flares give rise to almost pure\par
streams of protons which reach the earth and\par
continue to arrive for as long as 11 days .\par
the energies of these particles lie within a\par
very steep spectrum extending from 20 to\par
least 500 mev .  because of the frequency\par
of large flares during times of high solar\par
activity, and owing to the long duration of each\par
solar proton emission, these particles were\par
present in detectable intensity near the top\par
of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent\par
of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number\par
of large flares that accelerated and released\par
these particles during this three-year period was about 30 .\par
  the event that began on august 22, 1958\par
contributed greatly toward the understanding\par
of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,\par
and in addition provided the first\par
identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may\par
of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that\par
this phenomenon was recognized as an\par
additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles\par
in the high atmosphere and in most parts\par
of the solar system .  the three very intense\par
events that occurred in july, 1959 further\par
supported this conclusion, and the possibility\par
of predicting such events became an\par
important consideration .  in addition to its value\par
in the protection of human beings, effective\par
forecasting clearly would be of great value in\par
the detailed scientific study of this\par
phenomenon .\par
  this paper presents a preliminary\par

  this report presents the results of an experimental\par
investigation of the downstream influence of localized mass transfer in the\par
stagnation region of a blunt body under hypersonic flow\par
conditions .  the coolant is injected through a porous plug coaxial\par
with the centerline of symmetry of the model .  the tests were\par
carried out in a wind tunnel with a mach number of 6.0,\par
stagnation temperatures of approximately 1,600 r., and a stagnation\par
pressure of approximately 600 psia .  four different gases were\par
injected over a range of mass flows .  the heat transfer on the\par
impermeable section was measured under isothermal wall\par
conditions,. for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surface\par
temperatures were also determined .  the theoretical analysis of the\par
boundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish the\par
similarity parameters for the flow system .  these parameters permit\par
the extrapolation of the test results to other flow conditions,\par
provided that laminar flow prevails .  helium is found to be the\par
most efficacious coolant .\par

on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying\par
through the atmosphere .\par
  the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic\par
speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times\par
required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)\par
to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas\par
particle, are important in determining the observable effects of\par
hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection\par
of electromagnetic waves from the trail .\par
  in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is\par
divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,\par
which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a\par
point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to\par
the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the\par
expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,\par
where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the\par
high-temperature core .\par
  the influence of the details of the body shape on the\par
observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for\par
the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based\par
on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume\par
thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the\par
thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial\par
distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density\par
distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the\par
conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that\par
viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion\par
of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight\par
velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and\par
altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .\par

an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure\par

  the present article describes an investigation of several types of\par
separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed\par
in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two\par
dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and\par
subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry,\par
and the pressure field are described in this paper .\par
  a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of\par
the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated\par
regions .\par
  it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length\par
of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression\par
in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving\par
mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion .\par
this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent\par
transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or\par
turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and\par
reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the\par
conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary\par
depth is proposed .\par
  detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a\par
cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio\par
of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be\par
the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches\par
the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion\par
of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear\par
layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction\par
governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly\par
constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches\par
the shear layer bends inward at separation and\par
curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the\par
floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure\par
at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient\par
with mach number reflects the change from one to the other\par
mechanism of recompression .\par
  detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a\par
blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as\par
well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented\par
and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of\par
the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of\par
steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate\par
for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary .\par
  results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial\par
boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth)\par
and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .\par

the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially\par
symmetric laminar boundary layer flow .\par
  the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially\par
symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated,\par
and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter\par
which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness\par
to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco\par
integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are\par
still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse\par
curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of\par
mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer\par
equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form,\par
making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions\par
characterized by and less than or of the order of unity .\par
it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily\par
concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term\par
in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them\par
from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external\par
favorable pressure gradient .\par
  except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the\par
of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in\par
ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity\par
but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic\par
solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature\par
distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the\par
body shapes are given by and and (2) the\par
velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external\par
velocity of the form past a body given by .  the\par
zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a\par
linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found\par
for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar\par
profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that .\par
here, similar is used in the restricted meaning\par
that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential\par
equations .\par
  in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient\par
where the equations have been numerically integrated for,\par
the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that\par
the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer\par
rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than\par
or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are\par
increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream\par
temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other\par
conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction\par
coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater\par
than that on the cone .\par
  for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term\par
behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to\par
delay both separation and transition when compared with axially\par
symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is\par
neglected .\par

review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from\par

a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,\par
especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to\par
turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the\par
available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition\par
reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a\par
function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the\par
displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional\par
relation being a better representation of the data than a constant\par
critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the\par
effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial\par
turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the\par
rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height\par
of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer\par
at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape\par
when transition occurs downstream from the\par
roughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio\par
dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and\par
airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and\par
remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased .\par

roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the\par
published data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils .\par

  by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper\par
treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the\par
interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface\par
of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic\par
stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane,\par
steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane\par
surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be\par
extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic\par
flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow\par
is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface\par
on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean\par
temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity\par
distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a\par
relation between mean temperature and mean velocity .\par
mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to\par
dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process\par
determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow .\par
with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is\par
shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer\par
shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base\par
pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic\par
nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .\par

statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain\par

squares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o.\par
reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent\par
stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the\par
different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the\par
establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the\par
turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity\par
fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean\par
velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of\par
the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman\par
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the\par
hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to\par
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the\par
experimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his\par
analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and\par
was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of\par
turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory\par
raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important\par
problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared\par
directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by\par
fage, townend and simmons in england .\par
the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with\par

vibration isolation of aircraft power plants .\par
vibration in aircraft structure can almost\par

from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted\par
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air\par
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent\par
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct\par
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power\par
plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has\par
always caused the preponderance of disturbance .\par
vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting\par
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the\par
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life\par
of the entire aircraft structure .  more important,\par
however, are the psychological and physiological\par
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise\par
on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely\par
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so\par
intimately associated with flying .  the importance\par
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can\par
hardly be questioned .\par
  this paper is limited to a consideration of the\par
directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the\par

to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body\par
of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case\par

laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight\par
speeds .\par
this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over\par
blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation\par
temperatures..  (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical\par
reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion\par
across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the\par
volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/\par
compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density\par
near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density\par
just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation\par
enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the\par
more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in\par
case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is\par
represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient\par
value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained\par
directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to\par
illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases\par
of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a\par
spherical segment .\par
in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the\par
diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the\par
low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced\par
by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are\par
also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate\par

  author investigates the existence of a class of similar solutions\par

free convection in a nonconducting fluid .  the magnetic field acts\par
transversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constant\par

the momentum equation a retarding force which is a function only\par
of x, the distance along the plate length .  for similarity it is\par

  in this paper the incompressible boundary layer over a\par

the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel .\par
  a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working\par
section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with\par
varying spacing .\par
  the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the\par
flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear\par
variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream\par
without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near\par
the grid .  a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the\par
rods is described .  although this method is strictly applicable\par
only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid\par
designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in\par
close agreement with the theory .  there was no evidence from\par
the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying\par
the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the\par
resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the\par
shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .\par

dynamics of a dissociating gas .\par
  this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation\par
in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow\par
past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec .\par
thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near\par
equilibrium for transport properties and of large\par
departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .\par
  following a survey of the equilibrium statistical\par
thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a\par
new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is\par
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic\par
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation .\par
physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational\par
modes always just half excited (so that at low\par
temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather\par
then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas\par
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations\par
deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an\par
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any\par
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations\par
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along\par
streamlines between shocks .\par
  various of these results are applied to the problem\par
typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the\par
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification\par
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the\par
limit for large values of both mach number and density\par
ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero\par
surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory\par
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock\par
wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the\par
subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another\par
approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation\par
streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational\par
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a\par
spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body .\par
the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that\par
predicted by freeman's second approximation based on\par
the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),\par

  following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the\par

field is assumed to have a scale small compared to\par
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect\par
with constant speed over the plate .  two cases are\par
considered, one in which the convection speed is much\par
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,\par
the other in which the convection speed is the same\par
order as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square plate\par
displacement is shown to be relatively independent\par
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural\par
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in\par
the order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown that\par
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means\par
of vibration reduction .  in the case of convection\par
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of\par
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement\par

approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at\par
zero incidence as well as at angle of attack .\par
such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented\par

well at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lower\par
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from\par
circular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory\par

a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off\par
distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the\par
experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution\par
to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other\par
coolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of this\par
parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure\par
distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which\par
boundary-layer-type similarity applies .\par
  significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with\par
injection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the\par
peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be\par
an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation\par
point without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition is\par

  measurements of average skin friction of the turbulent\par

foreign gas injection .  measurements of total skin-friction drag\par
were obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, and\par
x 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12\par
through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skin\par
friction are realized with gas injection within the range of mach\par
numbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction is\par
in accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are most\par
effective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a marked\par
effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.\par
this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited\par
transition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer\par
does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point\par
approaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  the\par
variation of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rates\par
with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds\par
number and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates the\par
skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent\par

two-dimensional jet mixing of a compressible fluid .\par
  the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into\par
a supersonic stream are investigated theoretically .\par
  in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar .\par
when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different\par
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of\par
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer\par
assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be\par
reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction,\par
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions .  it\par
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two\par
dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained\par
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small\par
perturbations .\par
  velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is\par
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a\par
jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full\par
expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been\par
calculated .  the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the\par
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of\par
momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of\par
temperature--i.e., the change of density .  compressibility has a\par
considerable effect on the properties of the jet .\par
  in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated .\par
by means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent\par
shearing stress may be expressed as\par
  it has been shown in this paper that\par
where is a constant that can be determined experimentally .\par
the value of n lies between 0 and 1 .  the exact value of n\par
depends on the condition of mixing .\par
  when the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above\par
is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion,\par
by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that\par
the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical\par
to that of the laminar case .  hence, the solution of the first part\par
of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that\par

sound propagation of convection on the one hand, and of diffusion\par
and relaxation on the other/, whose importance in the\par
determination of the structure of shock waves was first appreciated clearly\par
by sir geoffrey taylor .  as an essential introduction to the main\par
topics, author gives an exceptionally clear and valuable account\par
of the physical mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and\par
other diffusion effects, including relaxation .  the classical theory\par
of shock-wave formation is then discussed, and some extensions\par
are made .\par
  the remainder of the article is based on the demonstration that\par
the nonlinear equation for plane progressive sound waves, in which\par
convection and diffusion are taken into account to a first\par
approximation, can be transformed into burgers's equation, the general\par
solution of which was given by hopf and cole .  this approach, in\par
which all flows are continuous (they become discontinuous at\par
shock waves in the limit as viscosity, etc., tend to zero), allows\par
the author to re-derive and extend whitham's theory of the\par
formation and decay of weak plane shock waves, and to derive many\par
new results, such as the velocity distributions during the union\par
of two shock waves and during the formation of a shock wave .\par
the application of the same idea to non-plane shock waves is\par
also discussed, but more briefly,. in these cases, burgers's\par
equation is not quite such a good approximation as before .\par
  the article concludes with sections on sound waves whose\par
reynolds numbers based on the length scale of the flow and the\par
velocity amplitude are comparable with unity, and on the effects\par
of relaxation on the properties of shock waves .  the whole is\par
much more than a survey, and represents a very substantial\par
advance in the theory of sound waves .  it is the finest possible\par

some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary\par
layer flow .\par
  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a\par
two-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in\par
which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is\par
cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of\par
motion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are\par
solved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure\par
gradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the\par
surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are\par
modified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved\par
surface .\par
  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the\par
stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while\par
the stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the\par
most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases\par
considered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile\par
near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement\par
that a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the\par
potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to\par
have a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface\par
curvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .\par

note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid\par
flow .\par
according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies\par
at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as\par
composed of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow and a thin\par
boundary-layer region adjacent to the body .  this point of view leads to the\par
approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer\par
is negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flow\par
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge\par
of the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two\par
regimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based on\par
the boundary-layer displacement thickness .\par
recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this\par
classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the\par
two flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient has\par
been considered .  it is the purpose of the present note to point out\par
another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of\par
fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the\par
hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in\par
that theory .\par

it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar\par
or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined\par
from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrument\par
used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated,\par
heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of the\par
instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer\par
generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar\par
sublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an\par
instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate .\par
with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument\par
as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar\par
and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate\par
vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region\par

wakes in axial compressors .\par
the tendency in the past has been to assume that\par
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are\par
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant\par
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total\par
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation\par
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage\par
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade\par
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in\par
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common\par
assumption by most of the people working in this field .\par
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially\par
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an\par
assumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when given\par
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,\par
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the\par
distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact\par
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this\par
fashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,\par
this distribution will not normally occur when the\par
compressor is present and we may normally expect much more\par
nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with\par
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total\par
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the\par
attendant curved flow to support the static pressure\par
gradients .\par

the determination of turbulent skin friction by means\par
of pitot tubes .\par
  a simple method of determining\par
local turbulent skin friction on a smooth\par
surface has been developed which utilises a\par
round pitot tube resting on the surface .\par
assuming the existence of a region near the\par
surface in which conditions are functions\par
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical\par
constants of the fluid and a suitable length,\par
a universal non-dimensional relation is\par
obtained for the difference between the total\par
pressure recorded by the tube and the static\par
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin\par
friction .  this relation, on this assumption,\par
is independent of the pressure gradient .\par
the truth and form of the relation were first\par
established, to a considerable degree of\par
accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically\par
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter\par
being taken as representative length .  these four\par
pitot tubes were then used to determine\par
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations\par
on a wind tunnel wall, under varying\par
conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station,\par
within the limits of experimental\par
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was\par
found to be the same for each pitot\par
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and\par
leaving little doubt as to the correctness\par
of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses\par
were then made in the pipe and in the\par
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results\par
were plotted in two non-dimensional\par
forms on the basis already suggested and they\par
fell close together in a region whose\par
outer limit represented the breakdown of the\par
basic assumption, but close to the wall\par
the results spread out, due to the unknown\par
displacement of the effective centre of a\par
pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides\par
further evidence of the existence of a\par
region of local dynamical similarity and of the\par
correctness of the skin friction deduced\par
from measurements with round pitot tubes on\par
the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the\par
region in which the local dynamical similarity\par
may be expected to hold appears to vary\par
from about to of the boundary-layer\par
thickness for conditions remote from,\par
and close to, separation respectively .\par

skin friction in the laminar boundary layer in compressible\par
flow .\par
  from an analysis of the work of\par
crocco and others, semi-empirical formulae\par
are derived for the skin friction on a\par
flat plate at zero incidence with a laminar\par
boundary layer .  these formulae are\par
for the general case of heat transfer, and\par
when there is no heat transfer .\par
  the problem of heat transfer and\par
the effect of radiation are discussed in the\par
light of these formulae .  the second\par
formula is then utilised in the development of\par
an approximate method for solving the\par
momentum equation of the boundary layer\par
on a cylinder without heat transfer .\par
the method indicates that with increase of\par
mach number there is a marked forward\par
movement of separation from a flat plate\par
in the presence of a constant adverse velocity gradient .\par

supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous\par

  ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first\par
approximations to the external forces on slender\par
bodies of general cross section\par
with discontinuous profile slope .  two\par
classes of body are considered ..\par
bodies whose profile (typified by the local\par
radius) is continuous between the\par
nose and base, and certain bodies whose\par
profile is discontinuous, such as\par
bodies with annular or side air intakes and\par
wing-bodies on which the wing\par
has an unswept leading edge .  (where air\par
intakes are concerned, it is\par
assumed that they are sharp-edged and that\par
there is no /spillage/ of the\par
internal flow) .\par
  the following conclusions apply to\par
the former class of bodies .  the\par
variation of drag with mach number is\par
found to depend only on the\par
discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change\par
of the cross-sectional area, and is\par
thus independent of cross-sectional shape .\par
the drag itself is unchanged if\par
the direction of the flow is reversed .  the\par
expressions for lift and moment\par
assume the same forms as for smooth pointed\par
bodies, the lift depending only\par
on conditions at the base of the body .\par
  the general theory is applied to\par
winged bodies of revolution with an\par
unswept wing leading edge ..  the results\par
bear a marked resemblance to those\par
obtained by ward .  the results for wings\par

expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past\par
a sphere and a circular cylinder .\par
  this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher\par
approximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder\par
than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes\par
and oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the\par
consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular\par
one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for\par
taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution\par
for small reynolds numbers .\par
  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid\par
the regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are\par
presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions\par
are, respectively, of the forms\par
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made\par
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds\par
number, and and vanish with r .  substitution\par
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a\par
set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but\par
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each\par
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and\par
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that\par
unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the\par
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from\par
the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which\par
yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus\par
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each\par
expansion .\par
  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely\par
related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed\par
results for some further terms are obtained .\par

the generation of noise by isotropic turbulence .\par
a finite region, with fixed boundaries, of an\par
infinite expanse of compressible fluid is in\par
turbulent motion .  this motion generates noise\par
and radiates it into the surrounding fluid .\par
the acoustic properties of the system are studied\par
in the special case in which the turbulent\par
region consists of decaying isotropic turbulence .\par
it is assumed that the reynolds number\par
of the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is small .\par
  the noise appears to be generated mainly\par
by those eddies of the turbulence whose\par
contribution to the rate of dissipation of kinetic\par
energy by viscosity is negligible .\par
  it is shown that the intensity of sound at large\par
distances from the turbulence is the same\par
as that due to a volume distribution of simple acoustic\par
sources occupying the turbulent region .\par
in this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regarded\par
as a stationary and uniform acoustic\par
medium .  the local value of the acoustic power output\par
p per mass of turbulent fluid is given\par
approximately by the formula\par
where a is a numerical constant, u is the\par
mean-square velocity fluctuation, is the time, and\par
c is the velocity of sound in the fluid .  the\par
constant a is expressed in terms of the well-known\par
velocity correlation function f(r) by\par
assuming the joint probability distribution of the\par
turbulent velocities and their first two\par
time-derivatives at two points in space to be\par
gaussian .  the numerical value is\par
then obtained by substituting the form of f(r)\par
corresponding to heisenberg's theoretical\par
spectrum of isotropic turbulence .\par
  it is found that the effects of decay make\par
only a small contribution to the value of a, and\par
that the order of magnitude of a is not changed\par
when widely differing forms of the function\par
f(r) are used .\par

on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacle .\par
it is well known that according to classical hydrodynamics a steady\par
stream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultant\par
force upon an obstacle, such as a rigid sphere, immersed in it .  the\par
development of a /resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, or\par
when there is a sharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompany\par
it (helmholtz) .  in either case it would seem that resistance involves\par
something of the nature of a wake, extending behind the obstacle to an\par
infinite distance .  when the system of disturbed velocities, although\par
it may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached to\par
the obstacle, there can be no resistance .\par
the absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., but\par
it can hardly be supposed that a small degree of compressibility, as in\par
water, would affect the conclusion .  on the other hand, high relative\par
velocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alter\par
the conditions .  it seems worth while to examine this question more\par
closely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenable\par

the effect of shallow water on wave resistance .\par
  the general character of experimental\par
results dealing with the effect of\par
shallow water on ship resistance may be\par
stated briefly as follows ..--at low\par
velocities the resistance in shallow\par
water is greater than in deep water, the\par
speed at which the excess is first\par
appreciable varying with the type of vessel .\par
as the speed increases, the excess\par
resistance increases up to a maximum at a\par
certain critical velocity, and then\par
diminishes .  with still further increase of\par
speed, the resistance in shallow\par
water ultimately becomes, and remains, less\par
than that in deep water at the same speed .\par
the maximum effect is the more\par
pronounced the shallower the water .\par
for further details and references one\par
may refer to standard treatises, but one\par
quotation may be made in regard to\par
the critical velocity ..  /this maximum\par
appears to be at about a speed such\par
that a trochoidal wave travelling at this\par
speed in water of the same depth is\par
about times as long as the vessel .\par
it was at one time supposed\par
that the speed for maximum increase\par
in resistance was that of the wave of\par
translation .  this, however, holds only\par
for water whose depth is less than\par
for greater depths the speed of the\par
wave of translation rapidly becomes\par
greater than the speed of maximum\par
increase of resistance ./  in a recent\par
analysis of the data, h. m. weitbrecht\par
expresses a similar conclusion by stating\par
that for each depth of water there is\par
a critical velocity, but that the critical\par
velocity does not vary as the square\par
root of the corresponding depth .\par

width is independent of vehicle weight, dimensions,\par
and drag coefficient, provided these are the same at\par
the overshoot boundary as at undershoot .  the\par
corridors of certain planets can be broadened\par
markedly by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for\par
example, the 10-earth-g corridor width for\par
single-pass, nonlifting, parabolic entry is increased from\par
to 52, 51, and 52 miles, respectively, by employing a\par
lift-drag ratio of 1 .  the use of aerodynamic lift\par
does not increase appreciably the corridors of mars\par
and titan .  all corridor widths decrease rapidly\par
as the entry velocity is increased .\par
  terminal guidance requirements on accuracy of\par
velocity and flight path angle for successfully entering\par
various corridors are compared with analogous\par
requirements for putting a satellite into orbit, for\par
hitting the moon from the earth, and for achieving\par

planeto-centric motion, thereby converting a hyperbolic\par
approach trajectory to an elliptic orbit about the\par

an approximate analytical method for studying entry\par

  the pair of motion equations for entry into a\par
planetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary,\par
nonlinear differential equation of second order by\par
disregarding two relatively small terms and by\par
introduring a certain mathematical transformation .  the\par
reduced equation includes various terms, certain of\par
which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal\par
acceleration, and the lift force .  if these particular\par
terms are disregarded, the differential equation is\par
linear and yields precisely the solution of allen and\par
eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep\par
angles of descent .  if all the other terms in the basic\par
equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible\par
vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component\par
of drag force), the resulting truncated differential\par
equation yields the solution of sanger for equilibrium\par
flight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-drag\par
ratios .\par
  a number of solutions for lifting and nonlifting\par
vehicles entering at various initial angles also have\par
been obtained from the complete nonlinear equation .\par
these solutions are universal in the sense that a\par
single solution determines the motion and heating\par
of a vehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, and\par
shape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphere .\par
one solution is required for each lift-drag ratio .\par
these solutions are used to study the deceleration,\par
heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry into\par
venus, earth, mars, and jupiter .  from the\par
equations developed for heating rates, and from\par
available information on human tolerance limits\par
to acceleration stress, approximate conditions for\par
minimizing the aerodynamic heating of a trimmed\par
vehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are established\par
for several types of manned entry .  a brief study\par

skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow .\par
experiments have been conducted to measure in\par
incompressible flow the local surface-shear stress\par
and the average skin-friction coefficient for a turbulent\par
boundary-layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient .\par
the local surface-shear stress was measured by a floating-element\par
skin-friction balance and also by a calibrated total head\par
tube located on the surface of the test wall . the\par
average skin-friction coefficient was obtained from\par
boundary-layer velocity profiles . the\par
boundary-layer profiles were also used to determine the location\par
of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer .\par
data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbers\par
from 1 million to about 45 million with an attendant\par
change in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32 .\par
   the measured local skin-friction coefficients\par
obtained with the floating-element balance agree\par
well with those of schultz-grunow and kempf\par
for reynolds numbers up to 45 million . the\par
measured average skin-friction coefficients agree\par
with those given by the schoenherr curve in the\par
ranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 million\par
and 30 to 45 million . in the range of reynolds\par
numbers from 3 to 30 million the measured values\par
are less than those predicted by the schoenherr        curve .\par
the results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/\par
proposed by coles appraoch asymptotically\par
a constant value at reynolds numbers exceeding\par
mentioned constants and the limited reynolds\par
number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt\par
as to the validity of any turbulent\par
skin-friction law written on the basis of the present\par
results . hence, no new friction law is proposed .\par
   the frictional resistance of a flat plate was\par
calculated by means of the momentum method and\par
also the integrated measured local surface shear .\par
for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million\par
both methods give about the same result,. whereas\par
at lower values of reynolds number the momentum\par
method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for\par
the effects of turbulence results in a frictional\par
resistance as much as 4 percent higher than that\par
of the integrated shear .\par
the measurement of local surface shear by a\par
calibrated preston tube appears to be accurate\par
and inexpensive . the calibration as given by\par
preston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield the\par
results obtained from the floating-element\par

  in this paper simplifying assumptions\par
are made to allow an analysis\par

some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody\par
combination .\par
  the aerodynamic problems associated with\par
propulsion-system installations have assumed a role\par
of vital importance in the development of supersonic\par
aircraft .  although air-induction systems have received\par
moderate attention in the literature, considerably less\par
information can be found on the design and installation\par
of turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be\par
interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit\par
design .\par
  as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes\par
increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations\par
which are efficient over the entire speed range .  the\par
difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of\par
high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always\par
compatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it\par
is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle\par
and afterbody performance .  rather they must be\par
treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet\par
interaction with the external stream must be taken into\par
account .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame\par
designers must closely coordinate their efforts .\par
  some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle\par
afterbody combinations are outlined in this report .\par
particular attention is devoted to the influence of the\par
jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and\par
after-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock-\par
boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach,\par
although not precise, correctly predicts many trends\par
and is generally enlightening .\par

seven interchangeable nozzles were tested .\par
six of these were convergent-divergent, with a design mach\par
number of 2.0, jet base diameter ratios ranging\par
from 0.2 to 0.8 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from\par
convergent with a jet base diameter ratio of 0.6 .\par
  in the main experimental programme the free-stream\par
mach number was 2.0 and the boundary layer was\par
turbulent both on the after-body and in the nozzle .\par
measurements were made of the base pressure, the surface\par
pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust\par
and the nozzle mass flow, over a range of jet pressures .\par
this programme was supplemented by comparative\par
tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests) .\par
readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures\par
and the jet thrust at different jet pressures .  schlieren\par
photography was used extensively throughout .\par

base pressure and overall thrust .  the special case\par
of base bleed is discussed separately .  similar curves are\par
included for the static tests .  these show the effect\par
of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrust .\par

method compares the pressure on an annular\par
base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding\par

by pressure traversing .  the development of the jets was found to\par
depend critically on the strength of the shock waves in the core of the\par
jet at the nozzle exit .  with strong shock waves present the jet spread\par
very rapidly and was very unsteady .  the jet did in some cases break up\par
into large eddies of the same size as the diameter of the jet .  when\par
no disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreading\par
was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadiness .\par

some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in\par
aerodynamic research .\par
a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in\par
compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .\par
most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,\par
chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of\par
specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based\par
on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a\par
suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas\par
mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is\par
nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and\par
comprised of commercially available components .\par
calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs\par
comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of\par
three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given\par
mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture\par
wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be\par
appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a\par
corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages\par
can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .\par
the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and\par
proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel\par
temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at\par
flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel\par
temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the\par
relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with\par
temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall\par
within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer\par
research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl\par
number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .\par

base pressure in supersonic flow .\par
  the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake\par
configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an\par
extremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total\par
drag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure in\par
this region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimental\par
work has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a\par
satisfactory method for accurate predictions .\par
  this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally\par
confirm analytically deduced concepts .  a large amount of\par
experimental data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and\par
cone-cylinders has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 .\par
the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical\par
deductions .  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is\par
concluded that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effect\par
on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for\par
two-dimensional bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of\par
the order .\par

experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on\par

configurations producing leading-edge separation . results were\par
obtained from pressure-distribution measurements,\par

optics . the maximum scope of measurement encompassed\par
mach numbers between 0.4 and 3.6, and length reynolds\par
numbers between 4000 and 5000000 .\par
   the principal variable controlling pressure distribution in\par
the separated flows was found to be the location of transition\par
relative to the reattachment and separation positions .\par
classification is made of each separated flow into one of three regimes ..\par
and /turbulent/ with transition upstream of separation .\par
by this means of classificaiton it is possible to state rather\par
literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence\par
of reynolds number within each regime .\par
for certain pure laminar separations a theory for calculating\par
dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic\par
and supersonic experiments . this theory involves no empirical\par
information and provides an explanation of why transition\par
location relative to reattachment is important . a simple analysis\par
of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external\par
flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the\par
pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress\par
at the beginning of interaction . various experiments substantiate tnis\par
variation for most test conditions . an incidental\par
observation is that the stability of a separated laminar mixing\par

ratios between 0.05 and 0.10, boattail angles between --2.9\par

between 0.2 and 1.0 .  the tests were conducted at mach numbers\par

number and angle of attack were varied .  the lowest reynolds\par
number investigated was 0.2 x 10 and the highest was 3.5 x 10 .\par
measurements on each wing were obtained separately with\par
turbulent flow and laminar flow in the boundary layer .\par
span-wise surveys of the base pressure were conducted on several\par
wings .\par
  the results with turbulent boundary-layer flow showed only\par
small effects on base pressure of variations in reynolds number,\par
airfoil profile shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack .  the\par
principal variable affecting the base pressure for turbulent flow\par
was the mach number .  at the highest mach number\par
investigated (3.1), the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to\par
trailing-edge thickness also affected the base pressure significantly .\par
  the results obtained with laminar boundary-layer flow to\par
the trailing edge showed that the effect of reynolds number on\par
base pressure was large .  in all but a few exceptional cases\par
the effects on base pressure of variations in angle of attack and\par
in profile shape upstream of the base were appreciable though\par
not large .  the principal variable affecting the base pressure\par
for laminar flow was the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to\par
trailing-edge thickness .\par
  for a few exceptional cases involving laminar flow to the\par
trailing edge, the effects on base pressure of variations in profile\par
shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack were found to be\par
unusually large .  in such cases the variation of base pressure\par
with angle of attack was discontinuous and exhibited a\par
hysteresis .  stroboscopic schlieren observations at a mach number\par

a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic\par

steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is\par
investigated analyticially . with the assumption that air behaves\par
as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion\par
method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to\par
extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection\par
angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock\par
detachment . this result applies not only to the determination of the\par
surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the\par
whole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observation\par
is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by\par
extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave\par
curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure\par
distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of\par
attack .\par
an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin\par
airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found\par
to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach\par
numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . this\par
slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may\par
prove useful for some engineering purposes .\par
effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed\par
flow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particular\par
attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific\par
heats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below\par
to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially\par
as accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation is\par
verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a\par
generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable\par
for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine .\par
the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average\par
value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field .\par
this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for\par
imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows .\par
an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach\par
numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may\par
approach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that the\par
shock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the\par
busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach\par
number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with\par
reasonable accuracy .\par

the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x\par

  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected\par
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects\par
were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the\par

reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical\par
approximations .\par
  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the\par

propeller-research tunnel to study cowling-spinner combinations based\par
on the naca 1-series nose inlets and to obtain systematic\par

cowlings, which were also tested without spinners .  the effects\par
of location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surface\par

  variation with frequency parameter is substantially the\par

reynolds number there is little change in both derivatives\par
with variation of aileron angle for the condition of natural\par

  a forward movement of transition reduces the stiffness\par
derivatives at the smaller aileron angles, but at,\par
at the lowest reynolds number, an increase results .\par
  similar trends are observed for the damping derivatives above .\par
  comparison with vortex-sheet theory shows that the\par
measured values of the stiffness and damping\par
derivatives are approximately 0.6 of the theoretical values .\par
  measurements have been made of the direct\par
tab derivatives and cross aileron-tab derivatives for a\par

some measurements of the direct aileron derivatives have been\par
made for comparison with earlier results together with a\par
number of static derivatives for the wing and controls .\par

of the control hinge gaps .  some tests have been made with\par
the ailcron set at minus 8 deg and the tab at plus 12 deg\par

and (e) more difficult problems\par
of the flow about aerofoils in the presence\par

these oscillations were found during the course of an experiment\par
in which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was being\par
studied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream was\par
being reduced to unusually low values by means of damping\par
screens .  the first part of the paper deals with experimental\par

of the manner in which oscillations were discovered and how\par
they were found to be related to transition, and then how\par

noise in the interior .  the fluctuating exciting pressure distribution\par
can be represented as a pattern of moving waves (fourier integral) .\par
a running ripple in the skin follows underneath each wave, and the noise\par
is ultimately due to these ripples .\par
  the acoustic effects of the running ripples are calculated\par
for an infinite sheet,. this is considered the main result of the\par
paper .  supersonically moving ripples radiate strong sound in the form\par
of mach waves,. subsonically moving ripples radiate no sound .  formulas\par

the noise generated at subsonic speeds in a practical fuselage .  the\par
running ripples are almost noise-free, but multiple reflections at the\par
frames and stringers promote standing waves .  an assumption is used\par
to link the two kinds of waves, and this leads to provisional\par
calculations of noise level ..  on this basis the noise level is\par
predicted to vary as for thin boundary layers, changing\par
progressively to for thick layers ( = external air\par

propeller in yaw .\par
  it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw\par
develops a side force like that of a fin .  in 1917, r. g. harris\par
expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the\par
unyawed propeller .  of several attempts to express the side\par
force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none\par
has been completely satisfactory .  an analysis that\par
incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work\par
and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide\par
range of operating conditions is presented herein .  the present\par
analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form\par
of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may\par
be taken as the projected side area of the propeller .  the\par
effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic\par
pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by\par
the inflow .  the variation of the inflow velocity, for a\par
fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force\par
with advance-diameter ratio v nd .\par
  the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are\par
also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching\par
velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the\par
exception of the spin .\par
  further conclusions are ..  a dual-rotating propeller in yaw\par
develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating\par
propeller .  a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a\par
pitching moment in addition to the side force .  the pitching\par
moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal\par
to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the\par
propeller radius .  this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw\par
is small but possibly not negligible .\par
  the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the\par
exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of\par
charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been\par
presented without derivation in an earlier report .\par

theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic\par

  in special circumstances where a large work\par
output is required from a turbine in a single stage\par
it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the\par
nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at\par
inlet to the rotor .  as part of an investigation into such\par
turbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of\par
the rotor have been tested in a two-dimensional tunnel,\par
a design theory being developed concurrently .\par
  the first design, featuring constant passage width\par
and curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having\par
thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from\par
focusing of the compression waves from the concave\par
surface, with consequent flow separation from the\par
opposite convex surface .  it gave a velocity coefficient of\par
measured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning\par
angle of 140 deg .  the measured value compares favourably\par
with values from previous steam tests, where the\par
results have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92 .\par
  from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test\par
observations, a subsequent passage was designed\par
having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading\par
to a free-vortex passage of double the transition\par
curvature,. a small amount of contraction was incorporated .\par
schlieren photographs showed the flow in this\par
passage to be almost shock free .  a thin region of low-energy\par
air existed close to the convex surface, but\par
liquid-injection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow .\par
pressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity\par
coefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressure .\par
when allowance is made for turning angle and\par
reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably\par
with previous work .\par
  it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine\par
would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a\par
two-dimensional cascade .  however, the resultant pitching\par
tends to become very close, except at very large\par
turning angles, with the result that in some applications\par
difficulties could arise in the practical design and\par
manufacture .\par
  several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded\par
as still experimental .\par

operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines,\par

exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outlet\par
flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure\par

downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the\par

  to facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors,\par
an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring blade\par
performance in a stationary cascade at supersonic speeds .  a suitable\par
technique was developed and the losses in a variety of cascades were\par
measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any\par
possible application .  it was concluded that if a useful compressor is\par
to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to\par
the existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, and\par
thus a new approach is necessary .\par
  some of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonic\par

the supersonic axial flow compressor .\par
  an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of\par
axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into\par
the blade rows .  preliminary calculations showed that very\par
high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat\par
increased mass flows, were apparently possible with\par
compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their\par
blading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has been\par
reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient\par
supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound .\par
the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the\par
essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow\par
compressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,\par
large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which\par
extend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade\par
is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely\par
eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no\par
reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient\par
is apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the\par
compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as\par
to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is\par
proposed .\par
  as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three\par
possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of\par
the encouraging results of this study, an experimental\par
single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in\par
freon-12 .  in this compressor, air decelerates through the\par
speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at\par
subsonic speeds .  a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency\par
of about 80 percent has been obtained .\par

  the intensity of turbulence, the longitudinal and lateral\par

inch-diameter free jet were measured with hot-wire anemometers at\par
exit mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.7 and reynolds numbers from\par
  the results of these measurements show the following ..  (1)\par
near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream\par
of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent\par
of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately\par
increasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greater\par
than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the\par
maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until\par
the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching\par
similarity .  (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of\par
turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number\par
and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with\par
distance from the jet nozzle .  (3) farther downstream of the\par
jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases\par
approximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle the\par
lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not\par
vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal\par
scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about\par
mum moves out from the centerline .  (6) a statistical analysis\par

on the strength distribution of noise sources along\par
a jet .\par
  the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is\par
investigated by application of lighthill's\par
theory to regions of 'similar'\par
profiles .  the analysis refers to the\par
noise power emitted by a 'slice' of\par
jet (section between two adjacent planes\par
normal to the axis) as a function\par
of distance x of the slice from the nozzle .\par
it is found that this power\par
is essentially constant with x in the initial\par
mixing region (x law), then\par
further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters\par
from the nozzle) falls off\par
extremely fast (x law or faster) in the\par
fully developed jet .  because\par
of this striking attenuation of strength\par
with distance, it is concluded that\par
the mixing region produces the bulk of\par
the noise and must dominate in\par
muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat'\par
part of the jet must contribute\par
much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed .\par
  powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity\par
profile on total noise power are interpreted\par
qualitatively .  the behavior of\par
multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers,\par
both as to overall quieting and\par
frequency-shifting, is also interpreted\par
in the light of the results .  the\par
possibility emerges that such mufflers\par
may be improved without serious\par
thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .\par

  to help fill the gap in the knowledge\par

determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and\par
sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6\par
and with lengths and base areas\par
equal to circular cones of fineness\par
ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied\par
for angles of bank of 0 and 90 .\par
elliptic and circular cones in\par
combination with triangular wings of aspect\par
ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been\par
considered .  the angle-of-attack range\par
was from 0 to about 16, and the\par
reynolds number was 8x10, based on\par
model length .  in addition to the\par
forces and moments at angle of attack,\par
pressure distributions for elliptic\par
cones at zero angle of attack have been determined .\par
  the results of this investigation\par
indicate that there are distinct\par
aerodynamic advantages to the use of\par
elliptic cones .  with their major\par
cross-sectional axes horizontal, they\par
develop greater lift and have higher\par
lift-drag ratios than circular cones\par
of the same fineness ratio and volume .\par
in combination with triangular wings\par
of low aspect ratio, they also develop\par
higher lift-drag ratios than circular\par
cones with the same wings .  for\par
winged elliptic cones, this increase\par
in lift-drag ratio results both from\par
lower zero-lift drag and drag due to\par
lift .  visual-flow studies indicate\par
that, because of better streamlining\par
in the crossflow plane, vortex flow\par
is inhibited more for an elliptic cone\par
with major axis in the plane of the\par
wing than for a circular cone with the\par
same wing .  as a result, vortex\par
drag resulting from lift is reduced .\par
shifts in center of pressure with\par
changes in angle of attack and mach\par
number are small and about the same\par
as for circular cones .\par
  comparisons of theoretical and\par
experimental force and moment\par
characteristics for elliptic cones indicate\par
that simple linearized (flat plate)\par
wing theory is generally adequate even\par
for relatively thick cones .\par
zero-lift pressure distributions and drag\par
can be computed using van dyke's\par
second-order slender-body theory .\par
for winged circular cones, a\par

  when gases flow at high velocity, the rates\par
of internal processes may not be fast enough to\par
maintain thermodynamic equilibrium .  by defining\par
quasi-equilibrium in flow as the condition in which\par
the temperature, pressure, density, and velocity\par
deviate by less than a fixed, small percentage from\par
what they would be if the flowing gas could actually\par
be in thermodynamic equilibrium, criteria are\par
derived for determining whether quasi-equilibrium\par
is a stable condition in the flow .  by use of\par
excitation of molecular vibration as an example, the\par
general properties of criteria curves are discussed and\par
interpreted .  a discussion is given of how to use\par
these results to determine definitely whether a flow\par
is or is not in thermodynamic equilibrium .\par

energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the\par

an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation\par
of airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high\par
reynolds numbers .\par
and rapid method by which boundary\par
layer flow was rendered visible has been\par
previously described in the journal of the royal\par
aeronautical society .  it gave promise of\par
being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided\par
a denser smoke could be obtained, which at\par
the same time was free from the troublesome deposits\par
associated with the wood smoke .\par
of the aerodynamics division attempts were made\par
by the fuel research station to improve the\par
density of the wood smoke and to reduce the\par
deposits .  these they showed were conflicting\par
requirements, and whilst some improvement\par
was effected, it was not sufficient for observation\par
in the new tunnels at high speeds .\par
  the staff of the director-general of scientific\par
research and development, ministry of supply,\par
was then approached and it was decided to\par
develop an oil smoke generator from a simple\par
generator of this type which was demonstrated\par
to us .  this has been done successfully .\par
the final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke\par
generator is light and compact .  it takes\par
only a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired .\par
improvement on the wood smoke both as regards\par
density and freedom from deposits, which cause\par
premature transition .  the density and quality\par
of the smoke are now under control .  smokes\par
ranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour\par
to a heavy smoke dense white in appearance\par
can be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the\par
advantages of the wood smoke in that it is\par
non-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be\par
tolerated even when it is present in a considerable\par
concentration .  a certain amount of condensation\par
is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable\par
precautions troubles arising from this can be\par
avoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a\par
hard wax was successfully generated with the\par
same apparatus .  unfortunately because of its\par
flocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid\par
deposits when passed through bore tubing,\par
leading eventually to complete blockage .  this\par
seems to be a feature of solid smokes .\par
  the apparatus has been used to determine\par
transition and laminar separation points on model\par
wings in a number of the national physical\par
laboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been\par
maintained in the laminar state up to wind\par
speeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .\par
  there is much to be said for making a standard\par
practice of visualising boundary layer flow on\par
models, particularly as the technique is simple and\par
rapid .  it would greatly assist the\par
interpretation of force measurements and the more detailed\par
explorations of the boundary layer by total\par
head tubes and hot wires .\par
  the use of oil smoke is not limited to\par
boundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus\par
described in this report would seem to be\par
particularly suited for educational work in small\par
demonstration tunnels .\par

compatibility condition, which can be expressed as\par

is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic)\par
viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for the\par

on turbulen flow between parallel plates .\par
  the reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow of\par
incompressible fluid have been studied for turbulent\par
flow between parallel plates .  the number of these\par
equations is finally reduced to two .  one of these consists of\par
mean velocity and correlation between transverse and\par
longitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations only .\par
the other consists of the mean pressure and transverse\par
turbulent-velocity intensity .  some conclusions about\par
the mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuations\par
are drawn .  these equations are applied to two special\par
cases ..  one is poiseuille flow in which both plates are\par
at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at\par
rest and the other is moving with constant velocity .  the\par
mean velocity distribution and the correlation can\par
be expressed in a form of polynomial of the co-ordinate in\par
the direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratio\par
of shearing stress on the plate to that of the corresponding\par
laminar flow of the same maximum velocity as a\par
parameter .  these expressions hold true all the way across the\par
plates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layer\par
including the laminar sublayer .  these expressions for\par
poiseuille flow have been checked with experimental data\par
of laufer fairly well .  it also shows that the logarithmic\par

the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion .\par
this paper was written early in 1941\par
and circulated to the civil defence research\par
committee of the ministry of home security\par
in june of that year .  the present writer\par
had been told that it might be possible\par
to produce a bomb in which a very large\par
amount of energy would be released by\par
nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had\par
not then been used--and the work here\par
described represents his first attempt to form\par
an idea of what mechanical effects might\par
be expected if such an explosion could occur .\par
in the then common explosive bomb mechanical\par
effects were produced by the sudden\par
generation of a large amount of gas at a high\par
temperature in a confined space .  the\par
practical question which required an answer\par
was ..  would similar effects be produced\par
if energy could be released in a highly\par
concentrated form unaccompanied by the\par
generation of gas .qm  this paper has now\par
been declassified, and though it has been\par
superseded by more complete calculations,\par
it seems appropriate to publish it as it was\par
first written, without alteration, except for\par
the omission of a few lines, the addition of\par
this summary, and a comparison with some\par
more recent experimental work, so that\par
the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated .\par
  an ideal problem is here discussed .  a finite\par
amount of energy is suddenly released\par
in an infinitely concentrated form .  the motion\par
and pressure of the surrounding air is\par
calculated .  it is found that a spherical shock\par
wave is propagated outwards whose\par
radius r is related to the time t since the explosion\par
started by the equation\par
where is the atmospheric density, e is\par
the energy released and s a calculated\par
function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air .\par
  the effect of the explosion is to force most\par
of the air within the shock front into a\par
thin shell just inside that front .  as the front\par
expands, the maximum pressure\par
decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases\par
to be accurate .  at 20 atm. 45 of\par
the energy has been degraded into heat which is\par
not available for doing work and used\par
up in expanding against atmospheric pressure .\par
this leads to the prediction that an\par
atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as\par
a blast-producer, as a high explosive\par
releasing the same amount of energy .\par
  in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is\par
proportional to r, and comparison\par
with the measured pressures near high explosives,\par
in the range of radii where the two\par
might be expected to be comparable, shows that\par
these conclusions are borne out by\par
experiment .\par

cylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energy\par

  taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosion\par
has been extended to the cylindrical case .  it is found\par
that the radius r of a strong cylindrical shock wave\par
produced by a sudden release of energy e per unit length\par
grows with time t according to the equation\par
where is the atmospheric density and\par
is a calculated function of the specific\par
heat ratio .  for is found to be approximately\par
unity .  for this case, the pressure behind the\par
shock wave decays with radius r according to the relation .\par
applying the results of this analysis\par
to the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown that\par
the shock envelope behind a meteor or a high-speed\par
missile is approximately a paraboloid given by\par
where d and v denote the total\par
drag and the velocity of the missile, respectively,\par
and x is the distance behind the missile .\par

  the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for\par
conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the\par
shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled\par
boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .\par
  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on\par
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder\par
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and\par
roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .\par
transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on\par
the model surface .\par
  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic\par
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a\par
hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the\par
entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that\par
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition\par
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer\par
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the\par
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-\par
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition\par
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder\par
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds\par
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-\par
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .\par
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical\par
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an\par
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled\par
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition\par
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of\par
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition\par
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the\par
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer\par
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with\par
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-\par
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition\par
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-\par
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred\par
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000\par
based on local external properties and a distance along the body\par
surface from the stagnation point) .\par
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to\par
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the\par
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the\par
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer\par
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds\par
number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the\par
hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with\par
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant\par
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .\par

has a ballistic factor of 500 lb ft,\par
re-enters with a speed of 11 km sec at\par
ratio of 0.5, and is subjected to a\par
maximum deceleration of 7.7 times the\par

  by use of well known equations\par
for the heat transfer and the mass\par
transfer at a heated surface, a numerical\par
calculation method is derived which, for\par
the investigated ablation processes,\par
yields exact transient solutions of the\par
fundamental system of partial differential\par
equations .  the method is applied\par
to various quartz shields and to one\par
teflon shield, which all evaporate so\par
readily under the conditions of the\par
problem at hand that practically no flow\par
of molten shield material exists .\par
the solutions also show comparatively small\par
temperature changes parallel to the surface .\par

of the vehicle is cooled predominantly by\par
the evaporation of the quartz or the\par
teflon,. the rest of the vehicle's surface\par
is cooled by radiation of the quartz\par
or evaporation of the teflon .  the large\par
mass transfer effects on the nose of\par
the vehicle are detrimental since the\par
resulting low surface temperatures prevent\par
the radiative heat transfer out of\par
the shield, which does not involve any\par
mass loss, from being the desirable\par

reaction tests of turbine nozzles for supersonic velocities .\par
  a machine for testing turbine nozzles by the reaction\par
method, which was described in a previous paper, was\par
used to test a series of convergent-divergent turbine\par
nozzles .  the results of these tests, along with the test\par
of a convergent turbine nozzle, are compared with each\par
other and with analytical values .  two kinds of analytical\par
values are employed, namely, the usual values obtained\par
from an assumed isentropic expansion from inlet state to\par
exhaust pressure, and the values obtained from the\par
assumption that the processes in the nozzle are isentropic\par
except for a normal shock which takes up a position in the\par
nozzle such as to cause the stream to fill the exit area at\par
the exhaust pressure whenever possible .  this latter kind\par
of analytical value involves no shock when the exit area can\par
be filled at the exhaust pressure by means of isentropic\par
processes only, or when the exhaust pressure is lowered\par
so far that the shock has passed out of the passage .  the\par
agreement of the test results with the calculated results\par
of this latter kind is good, and the disagreement which\par
exists can be attributed largely to separation at the shock\par
and to transmission of exhaust-pressure effects upstream\par
through the boundary layer .\par

study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exit\par
of two-dimensional cascade of turbine rotor blades\par
at critical and supercritical pressure ratios .\par
  an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream of a\par
cascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical\par
pressure ratios .  the results of five theoretical methods for\par
determining the deflection angle are compared with those of an experimental\par
method using the conservation-of-momentum principle and\par
static-pressure surveys, and also are compared with an analysis of\par
schlieren photographs of the flow downstream of the blades .  a two-\par
dimensional cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 inches\par
was used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the\par
schlieren photographs .  in order to determine the flow conditions several\par
blade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs were\par
taken of the flow through a cascade of 18 blades having an axial\par
width of 0.60 inch .\par
  for the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressure\par
ratios considerably lower than that required to give critical\par
velocity at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangential\par
direction as predicted for the incompressible case .  as the pressure\par
ratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear\par
portion of the blade reached a maximum value and remained constant .\par
after this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of the\par
cascade took place with a constant tangential velocity so that no\par
further increase in the amount of turning across the blade row and\par
no further increase in the loading of the blade was available .\par

pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hot\par

boat-tail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure and\par
for decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number,\par
and free-stream mach number .  the addition of tail surfaces produced\par
only small changes in base pressure .\par
  for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximum\par
pressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of the\par
trailing shock .  the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jet\par
and free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by the\par

axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional\par
bodies could be treated the same way .  the method is based on\par
the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the\par

predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point\par

is investigated by theoretical and visual-flow methods for the\par
purpose of determining the proper vortex distribution to be used\par
for downwash calculations .  both subsonic and supersonic speeds\par
are considered in the analysis .\par
  it is found that the degree to which the vortices are rolled up\par
depends upon the distance behind the wing and upon the lift\par
coefficient, span loading, and aspect ratio of the wing .  while the\par
rolling up of the trailing vortices associated with high\par
aspect-ratio wings is of little practical importance, it is shown that, with\par
low-aspect-ratio wings, the trailing vortex sheet may become\par
essentially rolled up into two trailing vortex cores within a chord\par
length of the trailing edge .\par
  the downwash fields associated with the two limiting cases of\par
the flat vortex sheet and the fully rolled-up vortices are\par

the solution is obtained without recourse to von karman's\par
momentum equation by means of a coarse step-by-step procedure\par
in which each segment of the velocity distribution is\par
approximated by one of the falkner-skan family of similar flows .\par
  solutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any other\par
one-parameter approximate method, and in certain cases the\par
solutions become exact .  in regions of accelerating velocity, the\par
accuracy appears to be very high .  in decelerating flows,\par
separation is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutions\par
that is, the method is conservative in contrast to the von\par
karman-pohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predict\par
separation that actually exists .\par
  the method is the most rapid hand procedure known to the\par
author, provided the full history of the boundary layer is\par
required .  if only a thickness such as is needed at one point on a\par
surface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature method .\par
but, if several values of or other properties along a surface are\par
required, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature method .\par
characteristically, only four steps are needed between the forward\par
stagnation point and the pressure peak .  once the\par
velocity-distribution data are available, each step in a two-dimensional\par
calculation requires about 5 minutes, using a slide rule .\par

  laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been\par

reynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpy\par
ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5 .\par
two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model\par
which consisted of a spherically capped cone .\par
  the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic\par
boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the\par
conical portion of the model .  on the spherical portion the data\par
are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical\par
prediction .  some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to\par
the nose of the model .\par
  the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared\par
to two theories ..  (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is\par
based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account\par
the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate\par
reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/\par
conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with\par
the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more\par
accurate .\par
  for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily\par
modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional\par
heat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to\par
estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat\par
transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .\par

most treatments of magnetohydrodynamic\par
waves have confined physical\par
interpretation to cases when the alfven velocity a\par
is small compared with the sound\par
velocity a .  here we consider the 'low-beta\par
situation', in which a is much\par
larger than a .  then, except for two modes with\par
wave velocity a the only possible\par
waves are longitudinal ones, propagated\par
unidirectionally along lines of magnetic\par
force with velocity a .  these can be\par
interpreted as sound waves, confined to\par
effectively rigid magnetic tubes of force .\par
hall-current effects do not alter these\par
conclusions (in contrast to the high-beta\par
situation), and finite conductivity\par
introduces only small dissipation .\par
  an application is made to the flow pattern\par
around a body moving through the\par
f layer of the ionosphere, where, although\par
neutral particles have a very large\par
mean free path, charged particles interact\par
electrostatically and, it is argued, may\par
be regarded as forming a continuous fluid\par
whose movement is independent of\par
that of the neutral particles .  a body moving\par
at satellite speed or below would\par
then excite the above-mentioned unidirectional\par
sound waves, but no waves at\par
much faster alfven velocity .  these considerations\par
suggest that its movement\par
would be accompanied by a v-shaped pattern of\par
electron density (figure 2),\par
which might be in part responsible for some\par
anomalous radar echoes that have\par
been reported .\par

on a particular class of similar solutions of the equations\par

  by introducing the similarity concept to the two-dimensional,\par
incompressible navier-stokes equations and energy equation, a\par
particular class of solutions is found .  two general types of flows\par
are considered ..  (1) laminar free convection--i.e., flows which\par
take place due to a body force--and (2) laminar forced\par
convection .\par
  for free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions are\par
obtained for two different power-law surface temperature\par
variations, and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutes a\par
new type of boundary problem .  results of numerical\par
integrations of the equations are compared with solutions of the similar\par
boundary-layer equations for free convection, and it is\par
demonstrated that a range of surface temperature variations exists for\par
which the boundary layer equations are no longer valid .\par
  for forced convection, it is shown that the use of similarity\par
transformations provides an alternate method of deriving the\par
ordinary differential equations for some well-known solutions,\par
such as couette and stagnation point flows .  solutions are\par
obtained for radial converging or diverging flows between plane\par
surfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrary\par
powers of the distance from the orgin .  results of numerical\par
integrations of the ordinary differential equations are presented\par
for prandtl numbers of 0.01 and 1.0 and for linear surface\par
temperature variations .  some rather surprising results are obtained\par
for diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealing\par

first-order approach to a strong interaction problem\par

  the present paper concerns with\par
the strong interaction phenomenon over an\par
insulated semi-infinite flat plate with a sharp\par
leading edge .  in particular the main interest\par
is in the consistent treatment in which the\par
boundary-layer solution may be joined\par
continuously with the inviscid solution regarding\par
flow variables including pressure, normal\par
velocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and density .\par
  it is shown that the behavior of the inviscid\par
solution may be consistent with that of the\par
boundary-layer solution to at least first-order\par
approximation that is correct to the order of,\par
where m is the mach\par
number of undisturbed flow, r the reynolds\par
number based on the distance from leading\par
edge and the ratio of specific heats .  then\par
the first-order boundary-layer problem is\par
formulated under such an external circumstance\par
and an attempt is made for arriving at the solution .\par
  actual calculations are carried out for both\par
cases of air and helium .  from the solution\par
it is found that the region in which the viscous\par
effect plays a significant role is ranged over\par
from 0 to a certain finite value of n, say n, in\par
terms of the similarity coordinate n in the\par
corresponding incompressible boundary layer .\par
the numerical results moreover indicate\par
that the induced pressure is considerably smaller\par
than the estimate of lees (7) obtained by\par
his approximate method in which the effect\par
of the first-order induced pressure on the\par
boundary layer is ignored and no survey of the\par

scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds\par
and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .\par
  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic\par
speeds arise from differences between the conditions\par
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in\par
how they behave after separation .  for turbulent\par
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly\par
as the reynolds number is changed and in many\par
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent\par
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number\par
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed\par
artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel\par
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be\par
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by\par
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by\par
excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the\par
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than\par
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered\par
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever\par
possible .\par
  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,\par
and the results obtained by using them are compared .\par
in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement\par
is found, and explanations can be advanced for\par
cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and\par
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed\par
and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed\par
in interpreting the results obtained with transition\par
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10\par
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1\par
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner\par
wings) .\par
  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased\par
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are\par
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds\par
number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range\par
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may\par
separate from very close to the leading edge .  under\par
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the\par
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and\par
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .\par
more research is needed before sound recommendations\par
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed\par
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is\par
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .\par
  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples\par
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided\par
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even\par
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition\par
may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead\par
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there\par
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition\par
have been satisfactory .\par

dissociation phenomena .\par
the behaviour of this gas is investigated in flow through a strong\par

the gas receives complete excitation of its rotational and vibrational\par
degrees of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to the\par

begins . the variation of the relevant thermodynamic variables\par
down-stream of this region is then computed in a few particular cases . the\par

various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied\par
gas flow .\par
  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous\par
aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and\par
at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free\par
path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer\par
theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .\par
  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to\par
define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of\par
continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental\par
evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a\par
model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this\par
model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in\par
detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a\par
reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .\par
  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes\par
of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/\par
class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .\par
for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the\par
shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully\par
viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer\par
are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the\par
navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given\par
by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer\par
class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes\par
equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock\par
structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary\par
conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/\par
conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an\par
infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened\par
sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this\par
case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying\par
conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,\par
and heat conduction .\par
  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes\par
equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for\par
both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions\par
of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow\par
problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to\par
illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations\par
have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the\par
assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful\par
approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged\par
layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere\par
using the incipient merged layer approximation .\par
  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,\par
and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled\par
sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds\par
number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above\par
the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer\par
regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .\par
as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged\par
regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static\par
and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .\par
  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with\par
decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,\par
the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy\par
behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they\par
are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the\par
stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .\par
  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the\par
same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase\par
found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated\par
boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction\par
theory .\par
  a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental\par
data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and\par
the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations .\par
qualitative agreement is indicated .\par

influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer\par

in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at\par
hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on\par
the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of\par
steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp\par
leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal\par
shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large\par
region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave\par
very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly\par
curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the\par
boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,\par
and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave\par
larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,\par
and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the\par
framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave\par
influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt\par
leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against\par
the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental\par
data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this\par
parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the\par
leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical\par
and experimental study .\par

  a theory is developed which describes the effect of a general\par

laminar boundary layer on a flat plate in steady compressible\par
flow .  fluid properties are considered as functions of\par
temperature and local concentration of the foreign gas .  the diffusion\par
field is described by a differential equation that relates\par
convective and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currents\par
arising from gradients of concentration and temperature .  by\par
means of the usual transformations the system is reduced to a set\par
of ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformed\par
into a set of integral equations .  the latter is amenable to\par
solution by the method of successive approximations .\par

and reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds .\par
the special feature of this approach lies in the utilization of\par
diffusion fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effects\par

  author introduces his survey by a brief review of the history of\par
investigations dealing with boundary layers on impermeable solid\par
surfaces, and notes that no true theory exists for turbulent\par
boundary layers, the success of studies in this area having been due to\par
the introduction of artificial, if ingenious, assumptions which\par
permitted empirical correlations fd data .  the terminology introduced\par
by the author for distinguishing the different situations involving\par
mass transfer from the wall to the stream may give rise to some\par
objections .  for instance, /film cooling/ need not refer only to\par
the injection of a liquid, since applications involving gas film\par
cooling exist .  also, his restriction of the term /transpiration\par
cooling/ to refer to the injection through a porous surface of a gas\par
only of the same composition as the exterior stream does not enjoy\par
universal usage .  the influence of mass transfer on heat transfer\par
through laminar boundary layers and on the transition from laminar\par
to turbulent flow is described, with consideration given to the\par
question of the net effect of the stabilizing influence of surface\par
cooling and the destabilizing influence of injection .\par
  reviewer suggests that author's inaccurate statement to the\par
effect that /thus far the higher energy conditions do not threaten\par
to involve turbulent injection, so turbulent boundary-layer research\par
enjoys a fairly academic serenity broken only by its own\par
frustrations/ be excused on grounds of poetic license, although it\par
ignores the efforts being devoted to the pressing practical problems\par
of erosive burning of solid propellants (possibly the most common\par
example of a complete /aerothermochemical/ problem involving\par
distributed surface heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction\par
in a flow system) and of effusion cooling of rocket nozzles, both\par
of which involve turbulent boundary-layer conditions .  author\par
emphasizes the tedious experimental problems involved in research\par
on boundary layers with blowing, and notes the desirability of\par
velocity distribution measurements, especially in turbulent injection\par
layers .  the observation that no good data on concentration\par
profiles in the case of the diffusion boundary layer have been\par
published may be an overstatement, since author's bibliography\par
overlooks the work of j. berger (/contribution a l'etude de l'injection\par

an effective means of protecting the surface of a hypersonic re-entry\par
vehicle is to inject small quantities of a lightweight gas into the\par
boundary layer through a porous wall .  this process, which is known\par
as mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two ways .  first\par
of all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir through\par
the wall to the surface, a considerable quantity of heat is absorbed as\par
its temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wall\par
surface temperature .  characteristically, lightweight gases have\par
relatively high specific heats .\par
secondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusion\par
normal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundary\par
layer in such a manner as to reduce the temperature gradient at the\par
wall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wall .  this is\par

  the mechanics of the kinetic theory of gases is employed to\par
describe the drag force on the nose of a missile moving in the\par
super-aerodynamic region of the atmosphere .  three separate cases are\par
considered--ideal specular reflection, specular-type reflection\par
from a slightly rough surface, and surface absorption followed by\par
random emission of the striking molecules .  the calculus of\par
variations is employed to obtain the differential equation of the nose\par
shape which minimizes the drag force for each of the three cases .\par
the resulting differential equations are then solved by a numerical\par
procedure .  the drag coefficients for the optimum nose shapes are\par
likewise determined and these are compared with the drag\par
coefficients given by other nose shapes .  it is further shown that\par
the drag coefficients arising when specular-type reflections occur\par
are significantly dependent on the nose shape .  when surface\par
absorption followed by random emission occurs, the drag\par
coefficient is not strongly dependent on either the missile nose shape\par

an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter\par
in real fluids .\par
it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve\par
slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow\par
theory, even at small angles of attack .  as the stall angle is\par
approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus\par
deviates even more from the theoretical value .  pinkerton\par
employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure\par
distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment\par
is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory .\par
this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski\par
condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with\par
the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the\par
flow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving a\par
fictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory is\par
valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer\par
thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the\par
displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate\par
source distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated,\par
of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is\par
applied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, by\par
generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston\par
and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge\par
shall have the same value when determined from the\par
potential-flow values above and below the airfoil .  this procedure gives\par
qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady\par
flow .\par

a method for analysing the insulating properties of\par
the laminar compressible boundary layer .\par
  in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows\par
it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for\par
example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip,\par
and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer\par
to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling\par
on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this\par
upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with\par
optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes,\par
wings, and bodies of high-speed aircraft and missiles .\par
  in this paper a method for investigating the insulating\par
properties of a laminar compressible boundary layer on a two-\par
dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical\par
situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the\par
heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is\par
completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the\par
temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction\par
from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer\par
established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream\par
surface .\par
  the karman integral method extended to both the momentum\par
and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer\par
has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection\par
ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions\par
and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum,\par
and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous\par
by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity\par
and stagnation enthalpy profiles .  thus the velocity and\par
stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree\par
polynomials .  the resulting two integral-differential equations\par
are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along\par
the wall .  these two functions are related to the boundary-layer\par
thickness and to the wall temperature .  initial conditions\par
corresponding to a given initial wall temperature and an initial\par
boundary-layer thickness are prescribed .  exact closed-form solutions\par
for the case of zero axial pressure gradient are obtained .  for\par
flows with significant pressure gradients, numerical solutions\par
are required in general .  several numerical examples of practical\par
interest are presented .\par

some problems of polar missile control .\par
  a polar-controlled missile is one in which manoeuvre\par
is carried out by rotations about roll and pitch axes,\par
that is, in the manner of a conventional aeroplane .  this\par
paper discusses some problems in the application of this\par
form of control to homing missiles .\par
  in comparison with the alternative cartesian\par
configuration, this method presents some special design\par
problems .  in the former case, it is often possible to\par
resolve the motion into two planes and consider the\par
pitch and yaw control systems as independent\par
two-dimensional problems .  this simplification is not\par
possible in the case of polar control and it is usually\par
necessary to consider the whole three-dimensional\par
system .  the equations of motion which result are, in\par
general, not susceptible to analysis .  because of this,\par
the design of control systems requires extensive use of\par
simulators .\par

an approximate solution of the supersonic blunt body\par
problem for prescribed arbitrary axisymmetric shapes .\par
  the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out to\par
the first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodies\par
in supersonic or hypersonic flight .  this method is direct, in\par
that it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape for\par
a prescribed body .  results obtained by numerical integration\par
for several body shapes at several mach numbers are compared\par
to experimental results with good agreement .  it is also shown\par
that the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodies\par
with attached shock .  in the stagnation region, simple\par
relationships are found from the equations of the first approximation\par
which connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,\par
shock-detachment distance, and body curvature .  these\par
relations are also correlated with experiment for a variety of shapes\par
as a function of mach number .  the correlations permit a rapid\par
estimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important for\par
heat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shock\par
stand-off distance .  a method for a higher approximation is\par
described, for which, in contrast to the higher approximations of\par
belotserkovskii, a large number of simultaneous total differential\par
equations with unknown parameters does not occur .  one form\par
of this method has been studied numerically .  results are given\par
which, though only partially successful, indicate the amount of\par
improvement to be expected from a higher approximation .\par

theoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylinder\par
combination .\par
in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for\par
the determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies\par
and afterbodies at high mach numbers .  for quasi-spherical bodies\par
it has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination\par
with a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two\par
laws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal .\par
no simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies .\par
as for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave\par
analogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular\par
afterbody profiles .\par
the purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate\par
estimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field about\par
a hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow .  it was felt that since\par
experimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce\par

in a recent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data on\par
flows at m = 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted\par

hypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows\par
to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--\par
especially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the\par
entire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's\par
results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15\par
half-angle cones at m = 2.45 .  following the observation by charters\par

imply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the\par
convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone\par
with truncated tip .  they employ the mach-zehnder\par

the generalized expansion method and its application\par
to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds .\par
  it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be\par
generalized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of\par
which is flow about airfoils .  this generalized method predicts\par
the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and\par
resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on\par
the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with\par
which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the\par
divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of\par
secondary importance compared to those associated with the\par
curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface .  it is\par
shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as\par
well as two-dimensional hypersonic flows .  when they are met,\par
surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn,\par
may be related to the geometry of the surface .\par
  the validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for\par
three-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing\par
predictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and\par
bow shock waves of bodies of revolution .  the bodies treated\par
are two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5 .  tests were\par
conducted at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up\par
to 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the\par
ames aeronautical laboratory .  at the lower angles of attack,\par
theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of\par
mach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic\par
similarity parameter--exceeds 1 .  at the larger angles of attack, theory\par
tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides\par
of the bodies .\par
  as a final point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of\par
inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic\par
boundary-layer flows .  the question is answered in the\par
affirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial\par
check of this conclusion .\par

if the boundary-layer equations for a gas are\par
transformed by mises's transformation, as\par

along a flat plate of a gas with unit prandtl\par
number, the computation of solutions is\par
simplified, and use may be made of previously\par
computed solutions for an incompressible fluid .\par
for any value of the prandtl number, and\par
any variation of the viscosity with the temperature\par
t, after the method has been applied\par
to flow along a flat plate (a problem otherwise treated\par
by crocco), the flow near the forward\par
stagnation point of a cylinder is calculated with\par
dissipation neglected, both with the effect of\par
gravity on the flow neglected and with this effect\par
retained for vertical flow past a horizontal\par
cylinder .  the approximations involved by the neglect\par
of gravity are considered generally,\par
and the cross-drift is calculated when a horizontal\par
stream flows past a vertical surface .\par
when, and the boundary is heat-insulated,\par

  new methods are presented for the analysis of transient heat\par

surface effects .  these methods are in part a direct application of\par
some general variational principles developed earlier for linear\par
thermodynamics .  they are further developed in the\par
particular case of purely thermal problems to include surface and\par
boundary-layer heat transfer, nonlinear systems with\par
temperature-dependent parameters, and radiation .  the concepts of\par
thermal potential, dissipation function, and generalized thermal\par
force are introduced, leading to ordinary differential equations\par
of the lagrangian type for the thermal flow field .  because of the\par
particular nature of heat flow phenomena, compared with\par
dynamics, suitable procedures must be developed in order to formulate\par
each problem in the simplest way .  this is done by treating a\par
number of examples .  the concepts of penetration depth and\par
transit time are introduced and discussed in connection with\par
one-dimensional flow .  application of the general method to the\par
heating of a slab, with temperature-dependent heat capacity,\par
shows a substantial difference between the heating and cooling\par
processes .  an example of heat flow analysis of a supersonic wing\par

inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled non-equilibrium\par
processes .\par
  analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate\par
processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy\par
levels .  exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the\par
inverse method for inviscid airflow over a near-spherical nose\par
under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails\par
through the nose region .  typical conditions considered include\par
nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and\par
velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec .\par
  the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling\par
among the reactions considered .  these included\par
dissociation-recombination, bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactions .\par
the exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions\par
to be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n,\par
as they are in the case of a plane shock wave .  an important\par
difference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow,\par
however, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the\par
former .  this expansion reduces post-shock reaction rates .  as a\par
consequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom\par
concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below\par
those for infinite-rate equilibrium .  the reduction below the\par
equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for\par
nitrogen dissociation at higher velocities .\par
  in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated\par
by two-body collision processes .  the inviscid nose flow,\par
including coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to\par
binary scaling for a given velocity .  the binary scaling is\par
demonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the\par
exact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of\par
ambient density and nose radius .  this similitude, which can\par
also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the\par
shock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing\par
where it is applicable .\par
  the afterbody inviscid-flow problem is briefly discussed in the\par
light of the results for the nose flow .\par

two dimensional transonic flow past airfoils .\par
  this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for\par
transonic flows over symmetric airfoils .  the aspect of the problem\par
emphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressible\par
flow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the\par
mapping of the incompressible flow .  in the case of the symmetric\par
joukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,\par
but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate .  as\par
a result, the problem requires simplification .  instead of the exact\par
incompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which\par
is derived from a combination of source and sink .  this flow differs\par
only slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small .  by the\par
same method, the flow with circulation is also considered .\par
  after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this\par
fashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible\par
flow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any\par
essential difficulty .\par

on the behaviour of boundary layers at supersonic speeds .\par
this paper considers the implications of recent advances in knowledge of\par
 the behaviour of boundary layers in supersonic flow . only the simplest\par
 case is considered-dashthat of the two-dimensional boundary layer on a\par
flat plate, with nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperature\par
gradients .\par
it is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with success\par
in approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers is\par
closely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocity .\par
furthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundary\par
layers may be the same . a nonrigorous approach is made to the problems\par
of self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that their\par
effects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at mach\par
numbers greater than 5 and they increase as the surface temperature\par
builds up towards zero heat-transfer conditions . the effects with\par
turbulent boundary layers may not be so severe .\par
finally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of the\par
drag and aerodynamic heating problems up to m 10, and one result is\par
that, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers between\par
surface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and those\par
which may be thought necessary for preserving a laminar boundary layer,\par
then it may be better to choose the former .\par

buffeting and other effects of shock-induced separation .\par
the use of boundary-layer control to increase the separation-free\par
margins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point of\par
high-speed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impair\par
 the cruising performance or the landing and take-off characteristics .\par
the factors that influence the choice of method and details of its\par
application are discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintain\par
effectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of\par
separation positions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with\par
changing flight conditions .\par
research at the national physical laboratory that has embraced\par
high-velocity blowing, vane and air-jet vortex generators, and, in a\par
preliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly described . the\par
relative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some results\par
achieved in their application are given .\par
for vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex paths\par
determined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and their\par
images . thus, systems of counter-rotating vortices always leave the\par
surface in pairs and lose their effectiveness . co-rotating systems are\par
therefore preferred for many applications . blowing, which in\par
wind-tunnel tests gives results as good as or better than vortex generators\par
and does not have the disadvantage of a drag penalty at cruise, has not\par
yet been assessed in flight . air-jet vortex generators, which would\par
also avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significant\par
effects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities .\par

on the stability of two dimensional parallel flows .\par
  this is the last part of the author's theory of the stability\par
of plane laminar motion .  (for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same\par
quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .)\par
the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in\par
detail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion\par
of stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an\par
number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same\par
wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds\par
number is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of\par
viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the\par
general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical\par
significance is carefully discussed .\par
  the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called\par
neutral curve for the two characteristic types of\par
velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and\par
the symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the\par
neutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between\par
profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two\par
branches of the neutral curve approach and for\par
profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile\par
without a flex .  the most important results are as follows .\par
for sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always\par
exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a\par
similar result was obtained by synge from energy\par
considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the\par
motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the\par
asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further\par
that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond\par
which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence\par
the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .\par
  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate\par
expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his\par
general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these\par
approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius\par
flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds\par
numbers are based on the width of the channel and the\par
displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method\par
for computing the complete instability curve is presented\par
and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked\par
out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been\par
given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more\par
exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far\par
as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .\par
the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for\par
poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the\par
minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the\par
agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion\par
mentioned above is thus very good .\par
  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous\par
effects and of future developments concludes the paper .\par

an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed\par
cones at a mach number of 5. 8.\par
  shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured\par
on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a\par
range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles\par
of yaw from 0 to 8 .  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8,\par
and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in\par
determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution .\par
  the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed\par
and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified\par
newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the\par
normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow\par
shock .  cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in\par
determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and\par
over the conical afterbody .  on the 40 spherical nosed cone models\par
the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in\par
the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure\par
returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value .  for models with smaller\par
cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on\par
the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was\par
approached more gradually .  the shape of the pressure distributions\par
as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the\par
radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range\par
of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 .\par
  integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero\par
yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian\par
approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose\par
radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll\par
theory for sharp cones .\par

application of two dimensional vortex theory to the\par
prediction of flow fields behind wings of wing-body\par
combinations at subsonic and supersonic speeds .\par
  a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for\par
predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing\par
and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender\par
configurations at subsonic speeds .  the wing trailing-vortex wake is\par
represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the\par
spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the\par
exposed wing panels .  the afterbody is represented by corresponding\par
image vortices within the body .  two-dimensional line-vortex theory is\par
then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the\par
resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a\par
numerical stepwise integration procedure .  the method was applied to the\par
calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of\par
downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and\par
cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of\par
such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and\par
incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on\par
the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied .\par
the relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image\par
vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total\par
downwash was assessed at a possible tail location .\par
  it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted\par
the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations\par
with reasonable facility and accuracy .  a calculated sample wake shape\par
agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample\par
results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact\par
crossflow-plane solution .  an empirical formula was derived to estimate\par
the number  of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory\par
computation of downwash at tail locations .  it was found that the shape\par
of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind\par
a wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing\par
edge .  for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations\par
considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is\par
largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing\par
vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by\par
the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .\par

and the body was an ogive-cylinder\par
combination .  the effects of forebody\par
length and roughness and of the\par
presence of the adjacent panels on these\par

  the results of the investigation\par
show that large changes in the panel\par

result of combined angles .  a general\par
theoretical method based on slender-body\par
and strip theories was found to\par
yield results in good agreement with the\par

comparisons indicate that the changes in\par

combined angles are caused primarily by\par
a cross coupling between the\par
side-wash velocities due to angle of attack\par
and sideslip and by the presence\par

  an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transfer\par
distributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shape\par
and on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed for\par
laminar boundary layers .  the method involves the quadrature of a\par

the integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity,\par
wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station are\par
replaced by corresponding profiles from a family of similar solutions .\par
  the method is compared with other local similarity methods and\par
with experimental heat-transfer data on a circular cylinder and on a\par
body of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradients .  good\par
agreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that the\par
present integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, gives\par
generally better agreement with the data than certain other local\par

a factor affecting transonic leading edge flow separation .\par
  a change in flow pattern that was observed as the free-stream mach\par
number was increased in the vicinity of 0.8 was described in naca\par
technical note 1211 by lindsey, daley, and humphreys .  the flow on the\par
upper surface behind the leading edge of an airfoil at an angle of\par
attack changed abruptly from detached flow with an extensive region of\par
separation to attached supersonic flow terminated by a shock wave .  in\par
the present paper, the consequences of shock-wave--boundary-layer\par
interaction are proposed as a factor that may be important in determining the\par
conditions under which the change in flow pattern occurs .  when the\par
mach number is high enough, the attached-flow pattern exists because\par
then the shock wave is far enough behind the leading edge to keep the\par
influence of the high pressure behind the shock wave from extending\par
through the boundary layer to the immediate vicinity of the leading edge\par
and affecting the flow there .  some experimental evidence in support of\par
the importance of shock-wave--boundary-layer interaction is presented .\par

evaluation of high angle-of-attack aerodynamic derivative\par
data and stall-flutter prediction techniques .\par
  the problem of stall flutter is approached in two ways .  first,\par
using the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions on\par
wings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stall\par
range have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible with\par
available published data, with the purpose of providing empirical\par
information where no aerodynamic theory exists .  the major effects of\par
reynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamic\par
reactions have been reaffirmed .  no instances of negative damping were\par
observed in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative damping\par
occurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by other\par
experimenters .  data on the time-average values in the stall range of\par
both lift and moment are presented for the first time .\par
  second, the results of numerous experimental observations of stall\par
flutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at its\par
prediction have been examined, compared, and extended .  the sharp drop in\par
critical speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscillation\par
usually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutter\par
is apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changes\par
in moment due to pitch .  fairly good stall-flutter predictions have\par
been reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamic\par
reaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape,\par
reynolds number range, and reduced-frequency range .  a semiempirical\par
method of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoil\par
shape, reduced frequency, initial angle of attack, and amplitude of\par
oscillation has been presented .\par

  an experimental investigation has been made of some effects of\par

flutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wings .  the\par
assortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axis\par
and center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and 4 .\par
the relative-density parameter (where k is representative of the\par
ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of values\par
from 1.2 to nearly 14 .  special emphasis has been placed on the lower\par
values .\par
  the experimental investigation has been supplemented by an\par
analytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for\par
incompressible flow .  in a few instances corrections for the effects of\par
finite span have been made .  in general, the theoretical results\par
followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of\par
the relative-density parameter .  for these low values\par
the analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutter\par
not found experimentally .  at higher values of the flutter-speed\par
coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and\par

it is shown that theoretical calculations made either at the effective\par

therefore developed a modified theoretical calculation that agrees\par
reasonably well with the measured results of the tests of the n.a.c.a. 4412\par

aerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed\par
performance .\par
one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received\par
increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of\par
longitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream .  this\par
slipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing\par
characteristics .  in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with\par
a propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the\par
replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform\par
jet, free of all velocity\par
gradients .  the application of these theories requires that one equate\par
the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet .  one method\par
employed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the\par
average in the propeller slipstream .  these and similar procedures\par
are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit\par
assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence\par

a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundary\par
layer flows .\par
  a new and general method for solving\par
problems of plane and steady laminar\par
boundary layer flows in incompressible\par
fluids with arbitrary outer pressure\par
distribution is developed .  this method\par
is based on the introduction of the\par
dimensionless quantities\par
as new independent spatial variables .\par
ordinates, u(x) the given outer velocity\par
distribution, v the kinematic viscosity .)\par
the solution of the boundary layer problem\par
is then given as a power series in e\par
with coefficient functions depending on n .\par
this series is a formally exact solution\par
of the boundary layer problem .\par
  the new series solution has the following qualities ..\par
      have the significance only of cartesian\par
      coordinates, the influence of wall\par
      curvature being neglected in boundary\par
      layer theory, the new coordinates\par
      are adjusted to the data of the special\par
      problem in any case of application .\par
      the new variables represent a logical\par
      development of former efforts in\par
      the field of boundary-layer flow calculation .\par
      with other series solutions known for\par
      some special cases is that the leading\par
      term of the new series satisfies\par
      exactly the outer boundary condition\par
      at all cross-sections along the wall .\par
      therefore, the succeeding terms give\par
      corrections only in the inner part of\par
      the boundary layer .  accordingly,\par
      taking also no. 1 into account, the zero\par
      order term by itself gives a good\par

on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .\par
  the theory of the laminar boundary layer\par
offers a means of determining the skin friction\par
under the assumption of a given velocity\par
distribution outside the boundary layer .  owing to the\par
mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions\par
are possible only when the velocity distribution\par
is expressed as a simple function of the distance\par
along the surface .  more complicated velocity\par
distributions necessitate recourse to the method of\par
expansion in series or that of step-by-step\par
calculations, but the labor involved is too great for the\par
methods to be of practical use .  approximate\par
method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long\par
been recommended for general use, gives a\par
reasonably accurate solution in a region of accelerated\par
flow, but recently its adequacy in a region of\par
retarded flow has been questioned .  separation of\par
flow may actually occur where the solution of\par
pohlhausen fails to give it .  more recently howarth\par
solution, which gives fairly reasonable results in\par
a region of retarded flow .\par
  howarth's solution essentially consists in\par
solving the boundary layer equations for the particular\par
case in which the velocity u outside the boundary\par
layer decreases linearly with the distance x\par
measured along the surface, and utilizing the solution\par
by replacing the actual distribution of u by a\par
circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides .\par
therefore, it is assumed that the velocity\par
distribution at any section depends on the velocity\par
gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected\par
by the conditions upstream only in so far as this\par
affects the momentum thickness 0 .  in other words,\par
the velocity distribution across the boundary layer\par
is determined by a parameter .\par

proportional to the absolute temperature, and\par
that the prandtl number is unity .  various\par
results in the theory of incompressible boundary\par
layers are then taken over into the\par
compressible theory .  in particular, the existence of\par
method for retarded flows is applied to determine\par
the point of separation for a uniformly\par

an exact solution is used to show that this\par

a series of semispan delta-wing models with slender wedge airfoil\par
sections and very sharp leading edges .  the models had semiapex angles\par

the present paper describes a method for the approximate solution of the\par

the solutions are nonlinear, the analysis is sufficiently simple that\par
results are obtained in closed analytic form for a large and significant\par
 class of nonlifting airfoils . application to two-dimensional flows\par
with free-stream mach number near 1 leads, for instance, to general\par
expressions for the determination of the pressure distribution on an\par
airfoil of specified geometry and for the shape of an airfoil having a\par
prescribed pressure distribution and gives, furthermore, the correct\par
variation of pressure with mach number at mach number 1 . for flows that\par
 are subsonic everywhere, the method yields a pressure-correction\par
formula that is more accurate than the prandtl-glauert rule and compares\par
favorably with existing higher approximations . for flows that are\par
supersonic everywhere, the method yields the equivalent, in transonic\par

the influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoil\par
maximum lift .\par
  the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximum\par
lift are defined with experimental data obtained in a simulated\par
two-dimensional slipstream .  the experimental results show\par
that when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the\par
airfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the\par
slipstream .  in moving the airfoil from above to below the\par
slipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance corresponding\par
to the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer\par
observations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher\par
angles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled .\par
  it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the\par
non-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary\par
interference, but stems from the influence of the large local\par
slipstream shear on airfoil characteristics .  the effects of uniform\par
and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are\par
discussed, within the framework of existing first-order,\par
small-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote\par
stall .  a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer\par
in a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects\par
of stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria .  it is\par
demonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the\par
uniform-flow criterion applies .  it is concluded on the basis of\par
the experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon\par
stems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in the\par
inviscid theories .  it is hypothesized that it is a second-order\par
effect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative\par
of the shear, which was large in the present experiments .\par

real-gas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat\par

  the laminar-boundary-layer equations have been integrated\par
for the case of a flat plate over a wide range of free-stream\par
enthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies of\par
the gas at the wall .  the range of free-stream velocities extended\par
up to 25,000 ft sec at low free-stream enthalpies, corresponding\par
to local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds .\par
at low free-stream velocities, the range of free-stream enthalpies\par
extended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the local\par
conditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec .\par
the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at each\par
point in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected .\par
the solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried out\par
on a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction and\par
heat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations .\par
  before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and\par
johnson for computing skin-friction coefficients for the\par
perfect-gas case is reviewed .  for the real-gas case, the average\par
temperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h'\par
method is then used to compute skin-friction coefficients .  these\par
values are in excellent agreement with the computing-machine\par
results .  it was found that the recovery factor for the real-gas\par
case can be approximated by, the best results for the\par
cases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding to\par
the enthalpy, h', is used .  using this recovery factor and\par
reynolds analogy, heat-transfer rates can be computed which,\par
with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtained\par
from computing-machine results .\par

  author considers the equation of the yawing motion of a missile,\par

include the linearity of the aerodynamic forces, the constancy of the\par
aerodynamic coefficients with respect to mach number, the\par
absence of spin, and the absence of gravity .  if to these assumptions\par
one could add the common ballistic assumption of a constant air\par
density, the coefficients of this equation would have been\par
con-damped sinusoids .  in ballistics any slow variation of these\par
coefstant, and the solution would have been simply the\par
exponentially-ficients is usually treated by adding an approximate correction\par
term to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb\par
perturbation) .  however, with a body entering the planetary atmosphere the\par
variation of the air density is apparently of greater essence (this\par
is a point not stated explicitly in this brief communication), and\par
the equation is of the type .\par
the author shows that with a series of further transformations\par
the equation can be reduced to the form\par
the solutions of which are confluent\par
hypergeometric functions .  these functions are defined as series\par
involving gamma functions, and with a series of further assumptions\par
can be reduced to laguerre polynomials and bessel functions .\par
  it is certainly nice to have an exact solution to a problem which\par
has heretofore been extensively treated by approximations and by\par
the numerical approach .  this reviewer is puzzled, however, as to\par
the practical significance of the proposed approach .  an\par
idealization is of value in that it facilitates our understanding,. and the\par
numerical approach, in that it allows refinements of the problem,\par
freeing us from the necessity of idealizing .  but the proposed\par
solution is certainly more difficult to refine than the original\par
problem,. and it is certainly not simple (the solution of the original\par
equation is not the value of z, but the various /reverse/\par
transformations of z) .  an evaluation of a series in practice must compete\par
with the numerical approach,. and the equation suggested is of the\par
zero) .  viewing the problem /afresh/ (in the light of the /\par

with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbers\par
required .  specific consideration is given to the wall boundary\par

reynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities .\par
the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of a\par

heat conduction through a polyatomic gas .\par

is assumed to be polyatomic, with one\par

since this can be observed experimentally\par
without much difficulty .  solutions are\par
obtained for this quantity which cover a\par

and 'wall effect' parameters .  it is essential\par
to include proper temperature jump\par
boundary conditions for both active and\par

on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron\par
setting .  a simple experimental method with water as the\par
working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling\par
missile .  the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with\par
all-movable wings and fixed tail fins .  magnus data are\par
presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll\par
rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the\par
wings .  tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing\par
deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction,\par
thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due\par
to wing-tail interference .\par
  a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental\par
data .  a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is\par
introduced to predict tail-interference factors .  good agreement with\par
the data is obtained .\par
  this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical\par
magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either\par

the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a round\par

where p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0 .  it is well known that\par
the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of\par
compressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a round\par
leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance\par
assumption .  the linearized transonic flow theory has the same\par
short-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil\par
plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g.,\par
spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of\par
refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious\par
because the sonic point is usually located in a flow region near\par
the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness .\par

  an experimental investigation of the laminar, transitional, and\par
turbulent heat transfer rates over a conical cylindrical flared\par
body is presented .  regions of favorable, zero, and adverse\par
pressure gradient on the body are investigated .  the experimental\par
results are compared with the theories available in the literature .\par
  the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare\par
configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion\par
smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body\par
and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .\par
  the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over\par
a range of reynolds number from 0.3 x 10 to 1.6 x 10 per inch\par
based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall\par
temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to\par
the test with liquid nitrogen .  the stagnation-to-wall\par
temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .\par
  the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat\par
transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the\par
transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder\par
and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion\par
of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only\par
qualitatively correct, and underestimate the heating rate by a factor as\par
high as 3 .  conversely, the /flat plate reference enthalpy/\par
over the aft portion of the body, but to increasingly overestimate\par
the heating rates over the forward portion of the cylinder .\par
  a modified equation for the heat transfer coefficient in the\par
transitional and fully turbulent region based on the f.p.r.e.\par
method is then presented .  this method gives good agreement\par
with the experimental results presented over the entire range of\par
transitional and turbulent flow .\par
  from the results the following is concluded ..  cooling the wall\par
delayed transition .  by expanding the flow rapidly between the\par
cone and the cylinder, the transition reynolds number is reached\par
very rapidly .  by making a smooth transition between the\par
cylinder and the flare, no separation occurred at the cylindrical flare\par
junction .  the transitional and turbulent heat transfer in the\par
presence of an adverse pressure gradient may be predicted with\par
sufficient accuracy by the f.p.r.e. method .\par

shroud design for simulating hypersonic flow over the nose of a\par

following is an analytical method for designing a shroud which will\par
generate the hypersonic pressure distribution on a hemisphere .  the\par
method was found to be successful throughout the region of subsonic\par
flow .  this shroud was designed as part of a low-turbulence wind tunnel\par
used for investigating the effects of cooling on boundary-layer\par
transition on a hemisphere .\par
the design of the shroud contour was carried out in two steps .  first,\par
an approximate solution for the incompressible, irrotational flow\par
field was found in the region, and, second, the resulting contour\par
was corrected for compressibility near the sonic region, assuming\par

transition in the viscous wakes of blunt bodies at\par

  transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the hypersonic\par
wakes of spheres was detected in laboratory measurements of the\par
radiation from the flow field .  a hypervelocity gun facility was\par
used to fire models, 0.22-in. in diameter, into a range at velocities\par
from 10,000 to 17,000 ft sec .  experiments were performed by\par
changing ..  (a) the material of the projectile ,. (b) the ambient\par
gas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range .  three\par
optical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation ..\par
which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in the\par
range is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg .\par
which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 and\par
ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the\par
pressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm\par
hg for argon .\par
both air and argon, which show the main features of the flow\par
field .  above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation\par
from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear\par
to be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaks .\par
  the appearance of the streaks in the drum camera and\par
photo-multiplier data is interpreted as transition from laminar to\par
turbulent flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidence\par
shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical,\par
radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic\par
effects .  this conclusion is supported by other experiments based\par
on optical and schlieren techniques .  the transition in the wake\par
at positions very close to the body is given by a local reynolds\par
number of 10 for air, and 3 x 10 for argon .  the results indicate\par
a possible local-mach-number effect .\par

  the compressibility transformation first introduced by\par
dorod-nitzyn has been applied in this paper to the equations of the\par
turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate, considering heat transfer\par
and arbitrary prandtl numbers .  assuming the shear\par
distribution to be invariant under the transformation, the stream\par
function and the momentum equation take the proper form for\par
incompressible flow, allowing the use of incompressible velocity\par
profiles in the transformed coordinates .  application of crocco's\par
method to the transformed energy equation permits integration\par
of the energy equation resulting in a formulism remarkably\par
similar to that proposed by eckert .  finally, the reference\par
condition was chosen to correspond to the edge of the sublayer from\par
considerations of the assumptions made regarding the\par
shear-stress distribution .  with this choice, the reference enthalpy is in\par
good agreement with eckert's formula over the ordinary range of\par
test conditions .  in view of these results, the analysis may be\par
considered to provide a theoretical basis for the\par

small disturbance flow theory .  some related\par

biot's variational principle in heat conduction .\par
  biot's variational principle is applied to a number of different\par
one-dimensional heat conduction problems .  these problems\par
show the applicability of the variational principle to problems\par
involving prescribed heat flux boundary conditions and to those\par
with temperature-dependent material properties .\par
  a method is introduced for including boundary conditions\par
when these are expressed as prescribed heat fluxes .  the idea\par
behind this is overall energy balance within the body, which is a\par
constraint condition to be satisfied by the time histories of the\par
generalized coordinates .\par
  the variational principle is then applied to the well-known\par
problem of constant surface heat flux in order to present the\par
technique and provide a basis for the remaining sections .  the\par
equivalence of the result obtained in applying the variational\par
principle for a prescribed surface temperature history to that\par
obtained for a prescribed heat flux is also pointed out .  radiation\par
cooling due to fourth power radiation from semi-infinite solids\par
and finite slabs together with radiation according to newton's\par
law of cooling is then treated .  finally, the introduction of\par
temperature-dependent material properties is discussed and the\par

manner, and in the present note the theory\par
is developed for an atmosphere\par
in which h varies linearly with r .  equations\par
are derived which show how\par
perigee distance and orbital period vary\par
with eccentricity, and how\par
eccentricity varies with time .  expressions\par
are also obtained for the\par
life-time and air density at perigee in terms\par
of the rate of change of orbital\par

ways .  the first is to specify the\par
extra terms to be added to the constant-h\par
equations of part i .  the second\par
the best constant value of h for\par
use with the equations of part i .  for\par
example, it is found that the\par
constant-h equations connecting perigee\par
distance (or orbital period) and\par
eccentricity can be used unchanged without\par
loss in accuracy, if h is taken\par

above the mean perigee height\par
during the time interval being considered,\par
where, and\par
decreases from to 0 as e decreases\par

evaluated at a height above perigee,\par
where, and\par
decreases to zero as e decreases from\par

molecules equilibrate their translational and rotational\par

atmosphere .\par
in a recent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shown\par
that, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heat\par
flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed\par
the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the\par
stagnation point .  the ratio of turbulent sonic-point to\par
laminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has been\par
estimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 for a hemispherical\par
nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter)\par
increases from 10 to 10 .  since for an axisymmetric body\par
the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly\par
exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the\par
ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body\par
will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat\par
fluxes per unit area .\par

concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar\par
boundary layers and their separation .\par
  the theory of compressible flow in a laminar\par
boundary layer has been developed for the\par
case when the viscosity is assumed to be\par
proportional to the absolute temperature and the\par
prandtl number is unity .  (these assumptions\par
may be compared with the empirical relations\par
suggested by cope .)\par
it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate\par
normal to the layer can lead to a simplified\par
form of equation of motion very similar to the\par
ordinary incompressible equation but modified\par
by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure\par
term .  this factor is greater than unity at the\par
boundary and tends to one at the outside of\par
the layer .\par
  several particular solutions are considered\par
including accelerated flow with a linearly\par
increasing velocity and retarded flow along a\par
flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .\par
  the general implications of the theory are\par
discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn\par
when the mainstream velocity starts from\par
a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and\par
subsequently falls .  it is concluded that for\par
such a velocity distribution increasing\par
compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase\par
the boundary layer thickness and cause\par
earlier separation as compared with the incompressible\par
flow with the same mainstream velocity\par
distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding\par
to conditions at the stagnation point .\par

the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer .\par
  after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements\par
in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent\par
boundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear\par
combination of two universal functions .  one is the well-known\par
law of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, is\par
characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment .\par
these functions are considered to be established empirically, by\par
a study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any\par
hypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resulting\par
complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field,\par
the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the\par
boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data .\par
  the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately\par
interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly\par
represents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the\par
constraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile is\par
modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is\par
provided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetrates\par
the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow\par
and in the logarithmic profile near the wall .\par
  finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows\par
may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions,\par
considered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wall\par
component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing\par
stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied,\par
is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .\par

  at zero yaw angle the boundary layer over the\par
entire front half of the cylinder was laminar but at\par
yaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completely\par
turbulent, including the stagnation line, as\par
determined by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficients\par
with theoretical predictions .  the level of heating\par
rates and the nature of the chordwise distribution\par
of heat transfer indicated that a flow mechanism\par
different from the conventional transitional boundary\par
layer may have existed at the intermediate yaw angles\par
of 10 and 20 .  at all yaw angles the peak\par
heat-transfer coefficient occurred at the stagnation line\par
and the chordwise distribution of heat-transfer\par

the boundary layer on a slender body tends to be very thick at\par

flow deflections near the leading edge than those due to the body alone\par
flow around the boundary layer gives rise to an induced pressure with a\par
negative gradient which thins the boundary layer and increases the skin\par
friction with respect to the zero pressure gradient value .\par

flat-plate experiments in air, conducted in the c.a.l. 11 x 15-dashin.\par
hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall conditions, included measurement\par
 of surface heat-transfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero\par

measured by means of thin-film resistance thermometers at air test-flow\par
mach numbers around 12, free-stream reynolds numbers from 1.4 x 10 to 1.\par
for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from\par
ratios of about 0.15 . the range of test conditions at this stagnation\par
temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and\par
dominant viscous-interaction effects . heat-transfer distributions were\par
also measured on a sharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging\par
from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreek .\par
the experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the\par
foregoing theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects\par
of boundary-layer displacement and bluntness . the correlations obtained\par

viscous hypersonic similitude .\par
  an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developed\par
which takes into account the interaction effect of the\par
displacement thickness of the boundary layer .  a basic result of this\par
viscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional drag\par
obeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag .\par
additional similarity conditions governing viscous effects must be\par
imposed in this similitude .\par
  underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layer\par
independence principle .  according to this principle, the\par
principal part of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressure\par
and wall temperature distributions and free-stream total\par
enthalpy is independent of the (high) external mach number\par
distribution outside the boundary layer .\par

atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle .\par
the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is\par
 considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved\par
numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of\par
different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that\par
deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the\par
rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once\par
such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the\par
dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is\par
expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section .\par
 an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of\par
sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the\par
problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of\par
 conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted,\par
then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working\par
sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an\par
optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from\par
equilibrium .\par
it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected\par
 by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed\par
slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated\par
 to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing\par

significant changes in the bow shock geometry, stagnation gas state, and\par

large amounts of both atomic oxygen and nitrogen ahead of the body, the\par

chemically and vibrationally-frozen flow across the bow shock .\par

the present paper develops further one particular aspect of the\par
method,--i.e., the elimination of /ignorable coordinates ./  this\par
is accomplished by a special choice of generalized coordinates,\par
each of which is constituted by an arbitrary temperature\par
distribution and an /associated flow field ./  the latter is a vector\par
field which is derived from the corresponding scalar field by a\par
variational method .  the procedure is valid for a certain class of\par
nonlinear problems, provided we replace the temperature by the heat\par
content as the unknown .  it is shown that for normal coordinates\par
derivation of the associated flow field is immediate .  the use\par
of normal coordinates and their associated flow fields is\par
illustrated by an example .  introduction of dirac functions and\par
associated flow fields yields a procedure which constitutes a\par
generalization of the classical formulation by green's functions\par

one-dimensional problems of heating of a homogeneous or composite\par

different from the usual ones derived from the analogy of thermal\par

the results are applicable to stationary and transient\par
temperatures in elastic and viscoelastic structures .  the methods are\par

shown a progressive-type stall at low speeds . the amplitude\par
of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first\par
few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the\par
latter stages . a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating\par
stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low\par
speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with\par
compressor surge at high speeds .\par
     blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by\par
rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage\par
compressors .\par
      in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage\par
performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages\par
was considered . in general, the pressure drop at the stall point\par
is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical\par
formulation of compressor performance . compressor surge is\par
attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall\par
point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in\par
jet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may\par
result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic\par
characteristics of compressor surge . in this event, engine operation\par
will be limited because of the large drop in performance which\par
accompanies compressor stall  .\par

show that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressure\par
may be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving\par
chamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven\par
section .  for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always\par
be less than the driving pressure .  the use of air, helium and\par

achieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving\par

aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivatives\par
for slender bodies of general cross section .\par
  the problem of determining the total\par
forces, moments, and stability\par
derivatives for a slender body performing\par
slow maneuvers in a compressible\par
fluid is treated within the assumptions\par
of slender-body theory .  general\par
expressions for the total forces (except\par
drag) and moments are developed\par
in terms of the geometry and motions of\par
the airplane, and formulas for\par
the stability derivatives are derived in\par
terms of the mapping functions\par
of the cross sections .\par
  all components of the motion are\par
treated simultaneously and second\par
derivatives as well as first are obtained,\par
with respect to both the\par
motion components and their time rates of\par
change .  coupling of the\par
longitudinal and lateral motions is thus\par
automatically included .  a number of\par
general relationships among the various\par
stability derivatives are found\par
which are independent of the configuration,\par
so that, at most, only 35\par
of a total of 325 first and second\par
derivatives need be calculated\par
directly .  calculations of stability\par
derivatives are carried out for two\par
triangular wings with camber and thickness,\par
one with a blunt trailing\par
edge, and for two wing-body combinations, one having a plane wing and\par
vertical fin .\par
  the influence on the stability\par
derivatives of the squared terms in\par
the pressure relation is demonstrated,\par
and the apparent mass concept as\par
applied to slender-body theory is discussed\par
at some length in the light\par

from the edge and rolls up to form\par

a potential flow model of this is\par
constructed in which the layer is\par
replaced by a vortex sheet which\par
is rolled up into a spiral in the region\par
of the /core/ .  this problem\par
is reduced to a two-dimensional one by\par
assuming a conical field and using\par
slender wing theory .  the shape and strength\par
of the sheet are determined by\par
the two conditions that it is a stream\par
surface and sustains no pressure\par
difference .  use is made of results\par
previously obtained for the core\par

the sheet is dealt with by choosing\par
certain functions for its shape and\par

tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mounted\par
horizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operation\par
at m=6.8 and probably adequate for flows at m=8.2 with the existing\par
nozzles .  in its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680\par
degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnel\par
because of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater and\par
quick-acting valve which form, in effect, a large heat sink .  because of this\par
heat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperature\par
in the working section at the start of a run .  it is hoped to cure this\par
by preheating the heater outlet cone and the quick-acting valve .\par
at pressures greater than about 100 p.s.i.g. free convection through the\par
fibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the top\par
of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, which\par
results in /hogging/ distortion of the shell .  this free convection\par
cools the heater core and a vertical temperature gradient is set up\par
across it after only a few minutes at high pressure .\par

intensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of the\par

scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite\par

the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of the\par

h-p//dp/dy/ . the value of h, although important because/with the\par
molecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has not\par
as yet been well determined at heights above 200 km .\par
this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a\par
satellite's perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital period\par
of a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit . these methods are then\par
applied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose . the 44\par
 values of h obtained, for heights of 200-450 km, represent an average\par
over day and night and probably have errors/s.d./of 5-10( . it is found\par
that, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreased\par
greatly ..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to\par
height becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the\par
 supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km,\par
for 1959-61 . the results could be greatly extended in scope and\par
improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for\par

on the coupling between heat and mass transfer .\par
in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituent\par
will migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, and\par
the other toward the colder parts .  this phenomenon, known\par
as the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, were\par
discovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively .  the two\par
effects can also be considered as a simultaneous transport of\par
mass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer .\par
the effects of this coupling have been neglected in all\par
investigations of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far,\par
on the a priori assumption that they are small .  in a recent\par
publication however, it was shown that they can be large in\par
laminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection .\par
turbulent-boundary-layer measurements and an analysis conducted\par
at the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significant\par
effects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic wall\par
temperature .  from additional measurements, the results of which\par
are presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at the\par
model wall into one part depending on the temperature gradient\par
and a second part caused by the coupling .  it is shown that\par
the latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may not\par
be neglected a priori without careful consideration .\par

planform employing an air pressure seal between the ground and\par
the vehicle along the two streamwise sides .  the variation of\par
the optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressure\par
seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure and\par
maximum range is found .  it is concluded that a mixed\par
propulsion system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is required .\par
volume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed are\par
also calculated .  the maximum lift drag ratio is determined .\par
  the maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are considered\par
to be large compared with the ground-height vehicle-length\par
ratio .  two-dimensional airfoil theory is employed to show that\par
close to stagnation conditions exist below the vehicles .  the\par
lower-surface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamic-center\par
location are determined .\par

  the condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of\par

spectrum associated with lifting re-entry vehicles .  this is observed\par
by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits\par
of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the\par
constituents of air .  accordingly, investigations of the viscous and\par
inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge\par
slender bodies are made .  the investigations are generalized to\par
consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free\par
stream .  this condition is included in order to allow comparison\par
with the flow field about a model in the test section of a\par
hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free\par
stream .\par
  inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and\par
sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometries .  the\par
results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in\par
inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy),\par
is considerably diminished for this model .  this conclusion is\par
verified numerically by a characteristics solution for the\par
hypersonic flow about a /sonic-wedge/ slab .\par
  the viscous investigations consider the boundary-layer\par
interaction problem with a frozen degree of dissociation .  in\par
this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is\par
observed to be the ratio of the\par
dissociation energy to the free-stream kinetic energy .  the\par
influence of this parameter on the boundary-layer interaction\par
mechanism for a highly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presented .\par
the influence of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat\par
transfer is also discussed .\par
  finally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated\par
in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects\par
are present, the possibility of employing expansions with a\par

underexpansion on the surface with respect to the asymptotic\par
conical pressures are described as well as conditions leading to\par
bow shock inflection points .  conditions also exist for which a\par

various blunt-body methods are discussed .  for cones blunted\par
in such a manner as to keep the flow entirely supersonic, the flow\par
field is found to exhibit certain similarities with that for genuine\par

surface pressure, in the interior of the flow field rather than near\par

  an approximate method is used to obtain the\par
injection distribution which would exist on an isothermal,\par
transpiration-cooled hemisphere in a supersonic stream .\par
this distribution is the same for both air and helium\par
injection, and is independent of the blowing level .  a\par
model having this distribution was tested in the naval\par
supersonic laboratory wind tunnel at a mach number\par
of 3.53 .  it is concluded that the design technique is\par
reasonably accurate .  data taken near the nose are\par
compared with the theories for air and helium\par
injection .  the agreement in the case of the reduction in\par
heat-transfer coefficient is good .  the values of\par
insulated wall temperature obtained near the nose with\par
helium injection are 8 percent above the local\par
stagnation temperature, and largely independent of injection\par
rate .  it is believed that this phenomenon may be\par
attributed to the thermal diffusion of the helium within\par
the boundary layer .  air injection causes a slight\par
reduction in the insulated wall temperature .  it is shown\par
that injection of either air or helium at the hemisphere\par
nose considerably reduces the heat flux at the surface .\par

the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue .\par
the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue demands a\par
knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one\par
hand to metal physics at the other . at the present time the various\par
aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know\par
quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made . never-\par
the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of\par
construction in noise environments can be used with a limited\par
amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of\par
structure . this approach to the problem is adopted in this\par
lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the\par
moment . it must be emphasized, however, that although some\par
progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a\par
structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life\par
of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype\par
strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if\par
one is to prove the integrity of the design .\par
     within the structural limits of single skin construction set in\par
this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no\par
reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing\par
board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of\par
behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical\par
simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been\par
possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by\par
stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib\par
for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin\par
intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet .\par
     the most resonable basis for the future estimation of\par
fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n\par
curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the\par
necessary test data .\par
     the life expectation of a new design will be uncertain and\par
some proof testing is essential if the integrity of structure in high\par
noise levels (150 db) is to be guaranteed .\par

the cylinder walls at a uniform rate in\par
the range 1.55 x 10 to 1.08 x 10\par
of the free stream mass velocity .  the\par
local energy transfer along the cylinder\par
was measured at various values of\par
the wall temperature level for the\par
situation that the energy flows from the\par
cylinder to the boundary layer and\par
vice versa .  the results showed clearly\par
that the wall temperature for zero\par
energy transfer - the adiabatic wall\par
temperature - was larger than the free\par
stream temperature by up to about 40 f,\par
although viscous dissipation effects\par
are negligible .  this temperature excess\par
increases with increasing injection\par
rate and is independent of reynolds\par
number .\par
  an analysis in which the laminar\par
sublayer is treated as couette flow\par
with helium injection and which includes\par
thermal diffusion in this layer is\par
formulated .  the results show appreciable\par
thermal diffusion effects on\par
adiabatic wall temperature, increasing it\par
over its value for zero injection\par
by amounts of the same order of magnitude\par
as found by measurements .  thermal\par
diffusion however has negligible effects\par

a tentative searching after the principles\par
underlying such machines, it is only now that their\par
possibilities as commercial transport and\par
service craft are beginning to be developed .\par
  since the hovercraft is a new vehicle, the appearance\par
of the saunders-roe sr-n1, a manned\par
experimental craft, excited considerable public attention\par
and there have been a number of\par
descriptive articles in the press .  papers of a more\par
technical type, on ground-effect machines,\par
are now beginning to appear and it is to be expected\par
that these will rapidly increase in number,\par
especially since american interest in both the commercial\par
and defence fields is expanding fast .\par
  the authors of the present paper have, therefore,\par
concentrated attention upon features\par
about which they had something personal to say, and\par
which they consider to be of particular\par
significance for assessing the possibility of the\par
hovercraft becoming important in maritime\par

departure from dissociation equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzle .\par
the equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gas\par
through a nearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assuming\par
a simple equation for the rate of dissociation, and a number of\par
different values of the rate constant . the results of these\par
calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will\par
occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range\par
of values . they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun the\par
gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will\par
remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it\par
passes through a constant area test section . an approximate method\par
of solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow,\par
 has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the\par
deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if all\par
the assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack of\par
dissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of\par
hypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubes .\par
it is shown, however, that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a\par
 wind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may take\par
place in the nozzle upstream of the shock wave . even so, the stand-off\par

of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic\par
speed have been attributed to the development of such panel\par
oscillations .  it appears this\par
phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic\par
speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop\par
oscillations which cause instability of the structure .  this effect has\par
been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions\par
motion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem .\par
in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its\par
effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of\par
the panel material .\par
the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force\par
induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or\par
buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow) .\par
the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually\par
referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers\par
in recent years .  since the problem is too complex to be dealt with\par

  a summary of exact solutions of the\par
laminar-boundary-layer equations\par
for wedge-type flow, useful in estimating\par
heat transfer to such\par
arbitrarily shaped bodies as turbine blades,\par
is presented .  the solutions are\par
determined for small mach numbers and\par
a prandtl number at the wall of 0.7 ,.\par
ranges of mainstream pressure gradients\par
and rates of coolant flow through\par
a porous wall are considered for the\par
following cases ..  (1) small\par
temperature changes in the boundary layer\par
along a constant- and along a\par
variable-temperature wall, and (2) large\par
temperature changes in the boundary layer\par
along a constant-temperature wall .\par
  dimensionless forms of heat-transfer\par
and friction parameters and\par
boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated .\par
the results indicate that\par
coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall\par
temperature ratios diminished\par
the friction and heat transfer for a\par
constant wall temperature .  for a\par
variable wall temperature with small\par
temperature differences in the\par
boundary layer, the friction was unaffected,\par
but the heat transfer was greatly\par
increased for increased wall-temperature\par
gradient .  heat-transfer results\par
in the literature reveal that transpiration\par
cooling is much more effective\par
for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .\par

pressure gradient upon the local\par
rate of heat transfer through a laminar\par
boundary layer on the isothermal\par
surface of an electrically heated,\par
cylindrical body of revolution with a\par
hemispherical nose was determined from\par
wind-tunnel tests at a mach number\par
of 1.97 .  the investigation indicated\par
that the local heat-transfer\par
parameter, based on flow conditions\par
just outside the boundary layer,\par
decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at\par
the stagnation point of the\par
hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the\par
junction with the cylindrical\par
afterbody .  because measurements of the\par
static pressure distribution over\par
the hemisphere indicated that the local\par
flow pattern tended to become\par
stationary as the free-stream mach number\par
was increased to 3.8, this\par
distribution of heat-transfer parameter is\par
believed representative of all\par
mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of\par
temperatures less than that of\par
dissociation .  the local heat-transfer\par
parameter was independent of reynolds\par
number based on body diameter in the\par
range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .\par
  the measured distribution of\par
heat-transfer parameter agreed within\par
theoretical distribution calculated with\par
foreknowledge only of the pressure\par
distribution about the body .  this\par
method, applicable to any body of\par
revolution with an isothermal surface,\par
combines the mangler transformation,\par
stewartson transformation, and thermal\par
solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow\par
problem, and thus evaluates the\par
heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric\par
compressible flow in terms of the known\par
heat-transfer rate in an approximately\par
equivalent two-dimensional\par
incompressible flow .\par
  measurements of recovery-temperature\par
distributions at mach numbers\par
of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery\par
factors having an average value\par
of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which\par
increased abruptly at the shoulder\par
to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on\par
the cylindrical afterbody .  this\par
result suggests that the usual representation\par
of the laminar recovery\par
factor as the square root of the prandtl\par
number is conservative in the\par
presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .\par

hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing the\par
shock-layer concept . the present formulation takes into account the salient\par
features of the transport processes within the shock layer in a manner\par
consistent with the shock-layer approximation . the rankine-hugoniot\par
shock relations are modified to include contributions due to heat\par
conduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shock .\par
the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treated .\par
the flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether\par
 or not the transport effects are important immediately behind the\par
shock . in one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold\par
 across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on the\par
boundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficient . in the other\par
regime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but the\par
continuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution is\par
obtained . this solution reveals a substantial reduction of the\par
temperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in the\par
presence of strong surface cooling .\par
the present study is intended to provide a knowledge to bridge the gap\par
between the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via\par
 the continuum theory . in this respect, the solution obtained appears\par
to be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limits\par
for the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate .\par

  an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a.\par
full-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane\par
equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing\par
flaps .  the object of the investigation was to determine\par
and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane\par
and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap\par
deflection, and flap location along the wing chord .  the\par
chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the\par
wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0\par
to 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8\par
percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge .  the\par
investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution\par
tests, and downwash surveys .  the results give the lift,\par
the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the\par
airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure\par
distribution over the flaps and wing at one section,\par
and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing\par
combinations .\par
  an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from\par
the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the\par
airplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching\par
moment .  the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with\par
increase in flap deflection or flap chord .  flap\par
normal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap\par
deflection and were relatively independent of flap chord,\par
hinge-axis location, and airplane attitude .  the location of\par
the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of\par
the hinge axis remained practically constant\par
irrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or\par
location .  flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a\par
power of flap chord greater than the square so that with\par
regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most\par
efficient in producing a given increase in lift .\par
  split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the\par
magnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing\par
profile .  at low angles of attack the predominant effect\par
of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface\par
pressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively\par
the upper-surface pressures .  downwash surveys\par
indicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing\par
chord line would be more effective than those below the\par
chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of\par
the airplane with flaps deflected .\par

methods for calculating the lift distribution of wings /subsonic\par

this report contains some fairly simple and economic methods for\par
calculating the load distribution on wings of any plan form based on\par
the conceptions of lifting surface theory . the computer work required\par
is only a small fraction of that of existing methods with comparable\par
accuracy . this is achieved by a very careful choice of the positions\par
of pivotal points, by plotting once for all those parts of the downwash\par
integral which occur frequently and by a consequent application of\par
approximate integration methods similar to those devised by the author\par
for lifting line problems .\par
the basis of the method is to calculate the local lift and pitching\par
moment at a number of chordwise sections from a set of linear equations\par
satisfying the downwash conditions at two pivotal points in each\par
section . interpolation functions of trigonometrical form are used for\par
spanwise integration both in setting up the downwash equations and in\par
getting the resultant forces on the wing from the local forces . the\par
preliminary chordwise integrations for the downwash are predigested in\par
a series of charts/figs.1-6/,.it is these which make the method a\par
practical computing proposition .\par

solution of the linear equation and section 7 with the resultant forces\par
on the wing . some examples are worked out in section 8 to compare with\par
other methods,. one solution is given in full detail in tables 8-30 as a\par

the formulas of subsonic and supersonic wing theory for source, doublet,\par
 and vortex distributions are reviewed, and a systematic presentation is\par
 provided which relates these distributions to the pressure and to the\par
vertical induced velocity in the plane of the wing . it is shown that\par
care must be used in treating the singularities involved in the analysis\par
 and that the order of integration is not always reversible . concepts\par
suggested by the irreversibility of order of integration are shown to be\par

the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow .\par
a generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation\par
 relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leading\par
edges/to the given downwash distribution over the wing . the complete\par
solution of this integral equation is derived . this complete solution\par
is composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the other\par
antisymmetric with respect to the spanwise co-ordinate,. each part\par
represents a velocity potential . for example, if y is the spanwise\par
co-ordinate and x is measured in the free stream direction, then a\par
downwash of the form w-a ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise to a\par
symmetric potential, whereas w-a ux/y/sgn y is anti-symmetric and gives\par
rise to an anti-symmetric potential . the velocity potentials of such\par
flows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to and\par
including homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwise\par
co-ordinates . table iii gives similar formulae in the limiting case\par
were used over a cycle of the tumbling motion . the analytical\par

the use of conical camber to produce flow attachment at the leading\par
edge of a delta wing and to minimize the lift-dependent drag at sonic\par
and supersonic speeds .\par
in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thin\par
delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed\par
 there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached\par
flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift\par
coefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given\par
in terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding\par
 to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speeds\par
load distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and\par
 the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized\par
theory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with\par
 respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load\par
distributions . it is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these\par
conically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached\par
flow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing at\par
the same mach number, as more terms are included in the linear\par
combination . however, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable\par
reduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wing\par
shapes are calculated and drawn . the optimum shapes for a fixed number\par
of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so\par
that the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributed\par
force on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar\par
magnitude .\par

at mach numbers from 0.7 to 3.98 and\par
a frequency ratio of about 0.42 .\par
  the tests indicate that, in general,\par
increasing thickness has a\par
destabilizing effect at the higher mach\par
numbers but is stabilizing at\par
subsonic and transonic mach numbers .\par
double-wedge airfoils are more\par
prone to flutter than single-wedge\par
airfoils at comparable stiffness\par
levels .  increasing airfoil bluntness\par
has a stabilizing effect on the\par
flutter boundary at supersonic speeds\par
but has a negligible effect at\par
subsonic speeds .  however, increasing\par
bluntness may also lead to\par
divergence at supersonic speeds .\par

where real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces,\par

exhausts . these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a\par
 cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two\par
 cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/ . the hot jet, because of its\par
high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was\par
performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust\par
parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine . the cold jets\par
used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the\par
exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific\par
heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold\par
jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet . the tests were made over\par
 a range of jet-exit staticpressure ratios from 1 to 9 with values of\par

approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span in\par

the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change in\par
sinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratios\par
of 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspect\par
ratios of 0, 3, and 6 . for the elliptical and rectangular wings the\par
spanwise lift distributions were also presented . these functions were\par
calculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating\par
 harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from several\par
sources .\par
the results of these calculations indicate that the normalized\par
unsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape of\par
the plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,.\par
 however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-state\par
value is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of the\par
same aspect ratio . these results also corroborate the results of other\par
investigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with\par
 a decrease in aspect ratio . the shape of the spanwise distributions of\par
 the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independent\par

a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamic\par
forces on oscillating or steady finite wings at subsonic speeds .\par
a detailed description is given of a method of approximating solutions\par
to the integral equation that relates oscillatory or steady lift and\par
downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow . the method of\par
solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or\par
straight leading and trailing edges . moreover, it is directly\par
applicable to control surfaces such as all-movable tails but modifications\par
are needed to apply it to controls in general . applications of the\par
method involve evaluations of numerous integrals that must be handled by\par
 numerical procedures but systematic schemes of evaluations have been\par
adopted that are well suited to the routines of automatic digital\par
computing machines . these schemes of evaluation have been incorporated in\par
a program for an ibm 704 electronic data processing machine . with this\par
machine, a pressure distribution together with such quantities as\par
section or total lift and moment coefficients or generalized forces can be\par
determined for a given value of frequency and mach number and for\par
several /four or five/ modes of oscillation in about 4 minutes of\par
machine time . in the case of steady downwash conditions corresponding\par
quantities can be obtained in about 2 minutes of machine time .\par
in order to illustrate applications of the method, results of several\par
calculations are presented . in these illustrations total forces and\par
moments are compared /1/ with results of analytic procedures for a\par
circular plan form with steady downwash conditions, /2/ with results of\par
other theories and with experiment for a rectangular plan form of aspect\par

distribution for a harmonically oscillating finite wing in compressible\par

the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to\par
severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g.,\par
internal convection, transpiration, or radiation . it is this latter\par
mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper .\par
neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for\par
long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point\par
of refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient\par
 away from the leading edge . inclusion of conduction in the aft\par
direction reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to a\par
location that will radiate it out from the surface . for either\par
steady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is\par
reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge\par
shoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balance\par
between the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by\par
conduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface . the feasibility of\par
 such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge\par
shapes and materials . the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge\par
shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as\par
shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown .\par

critical heights for three types of roughness were found in a low-speed\par
wind tunnel . the types were /1/ two-dimensional spanwise wires, /2/\par
three-dimensional discs, and /3/ a sandpaper type . in addition to type\par
of roughness, test variables included the location of roughness,\par
pressure distribution, degree of tunnel turbulence, and length of natural\par
laminar flow .\par
the most satisfactory correlation parameter was found to be the\par
roughness reynolds number, based on the height of roughness and flow\par
properties at this height . the value of this critical reynolds number was\par
found to be substantially independent of all test variables except the\par
shape of roughness . this parameter also correlates well other published\par
 data on critical roughness in low-speed flow . the value of the\par
roughness reynolds number necessary to move transition forward to the\par
roughness itself was also determined for the three types of roughness and was\par
 found to be approximately constant for a given type of roughness .\par
an investigation of the limited amount of available data on critical\par
roughness in supersonic flow indicates that the effects of roughness may\par
 still be correlated by the roughness reynolds number . the value of\par
this reynolds number depends primarily on the mach number at the top of\par

improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds\par
associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible\par

characteristics of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability\par

so that flutter occurs in the range of a low-speed wind tunnel .\par
a particular type of construction for supersonic flutter models is\par
described in detail . methods of vibration testing, static testing, and\par
flutter testing are discussed . particular emphasis is placed on the\par
technique of varying flow parameters rather than model parameters to\par
precipitate flutter . the tool for varying flow parameters is the\par

this paper reviews some of the experience to date of using sandwich type\par
structures in severe acoustic pressure environments .  the methods\par
used for testing sandwich structures for acoustic fatigue are described\par
and their limitations considered .  experimental and theoretical work\par
relating to the damping and mode-frequency relationships of certain\par
sandwich configurations is also reviewed .\par
special attention is given to the estimation of the stress in the bond\par
of a honeycomb sandwich panel subjected to sudden pressure\par
fluctuations .  a /uni-modal/ theory is presented, relating the\par
mean-square bond-stress to the random exciting pressure and panel dynamic\par
characteristics .  this theory indicates that tensile bond stresses\par
may be encountered of up to six times the local r.m.s. exciting\par
pressure .  these must be combined with bending and shear stresses\par
to obtain the principal stresses which precipitate bond fatigue\par
failures .\par
finally, an outline is given of some of the lines of future research\par
which should lead to the achieving of the maximum possible fatigue\par
resistance from sandwich configurations .\par

near noise field of a jet engine exhaust .\par
  aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet\par
engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that\par
may cause structural fatigue .  studies of such structures have\par
been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved .\par
  the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary\par
turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for\par
a single operating condition without afterburning .  the\par
maximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found\par
to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in\par
the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit .\par
with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased\par
by 50 percent .  the largest sound pressures without\par
afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in\par
the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps .\par
  additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect\par
of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine\par
the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid\par
surfaces and corresponding free-field values .  near the jet\par
nozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low\par
power (approx. unity) of the jet velocity .  over-all sound-pressure\par
levels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field\par
levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along\par
the jet boundary .\par
  the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure\par
at any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary\par
and the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same\par
frequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from\par
the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on\par
a dimensionless basis .  also, the strouhal number of the\par
corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at\par
similar distances downstream .\par
  in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of\par
the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross\par
correlation of the pressure over the surface area .  cross-correlation\par
measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet\par
velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the\par
jet .  free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and\par
of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps\par
were obtained both longitudinally and laterally .  in addition,\par
correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the\par
surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the\par
distance over which a positive correlation existed .\par
  the region of positive correlation was generally found to\par
increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5\par
nozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter .  in\par
general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a\par
function of jet velocity or frequency-band width .  the distance\par
from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for\par
lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same\par
conditions and locations .  the correlation curves obtained in free\par
space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar .\par
  the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on\par
surfaces .\par

random excitation of a tailplane section by jet noise .\par
  the response of a section of tailplane structure to both discrete\par
and random noise pressures has been studied in detail .  initially the\par
specimen was mounted behind a jet engine and the induced strains were\par
analysed with the object of determining both the resonant frequencies\par
and the corresponding modes of vibration .  during these tests a survey\par
was made of the spectrum and correlation pattern of the jet noise on\par
the surface of the model .  secondly the specimen was mounted in front\par
of a loudspeaker in an acoustics laboratory and the structural\par
resonances were excited by means of discrete frequency sound .  the mode\par
shapes were studied in detail with the aid of a stroboscope .\par
  it is concluded that the tailplane skin on this particular piece\par
of structure only responds to any significant degree in one structural\par
mode .  although reasonable comparison has been obtained between the\par
random and discrete tests, it was not possible to calculate the induced\par

  the present paper contains an application\par
of a recently developed variational\par
method to the boundary value problem of the\par
bending of a clamped plate of\par
arbitrary shape .  it will be shown that this problem\par
can be linked to the simpler problem\par
of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain\par
of intermediate problems, which can be\par
solved explicitly and in finite form in terms\par
of the membrane problem .  in the\par
intermediate problems, the deflection converges\par
uniformly in the domain of the plate\par
of the clamped plate, and the derivatives\par
of all orders of the deflection converge\par
uniformly in every domain completely interior\par
to the plate .  (in the ritz method, not even\par
the convergence of the slopes can be\par
guaranteed .)  the method yields numerical\par
results for plates of all shapes for which\par
the membrane problem (which we shall call\par
the base problem) admits an explicit\par
solution .  as an example we shall consider a\par
clamped square plate under a uniform load .\par
this problem has been the object of\par
numerous investigations, some of which are\par
theoretical, while others are purely numerical,\par
use infinite simple and double series,\par
and operate with an infinite number of\par
linear equations and an infinite number of\par

formulae which become simple in numerical\par

  a 'second analogue', relating the flexural\par
problem when edge-tractions with the\par
extensional problem when edge-displacements\par
are specified, is believed to have been\par
first propounded in 1941 .  by introducing\par

the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial\par
compression .\par
in two previous papers the authors have discussed\par
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of\par
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of\par
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that\par
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times\par
higher than that found by experiments, but the\par
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different\par
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed\par
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy\par
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are\par
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these\par
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .\par
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the\par
authors were led to the belief that in general the\par
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be\par
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .\par
this point of view was substantiated by model\par
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic\par
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures\par
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in\par
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave\par
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first\par
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is\par
released once the buckling has started,. this explains\par
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .\par
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers\par
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by\par
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations\par
during the testing process .\par
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case\par
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial\par
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate\par
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops\par
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this\par
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of\par
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing\par
machine .\par

the behaviour of a cylindrical shell under axial compression\par
when the buckling load has been exceeded .\par
  the value of the compressive stress at which\par
a thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has been\par
worked out theoretically by southwell (1914) .  subsequent\par
experimental results, however, have indicated that this\par
value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion\par
which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .\par
  in recent years much work has been done on this problem\par
in america .  lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)\par
have concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatly\par
influenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and\par
tsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can be\par
maintained in a buckled state by a compressive load\par
considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .\par
  the present paper is an extension of the work of von karman\par
and tsien .  it shows that the smallest load which will\par
keep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third\par
of that given by southwell, a result in very fair\par
agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,\par
and so long as the stresses remain within the elastic\par
range of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its\par
original stiffness .\par

  the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or\par

understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,\par
acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions .\par
circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is\par
included in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiring\par
the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation\par
are specified .\par
  a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the\par
approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter\par
is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .\par
  closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics\par
of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics .\par
application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of\par
three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .\par

an investigation of the flow about a plane half-wing\par

  a study has been made of the flow development\par
over the wing as the incidence and stream\par
mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure\par
distributions and oil-flow patterns .  the growth\par
and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and\par
forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for\par
flow separation through these shocks are considered .  for\par
the rear shock, which has little sweep, these\par
conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation\par
on two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward\par
shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems\par
to correspond to two rather different but\par
simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the\par
component mach number normal to the shock front\par
and the other to the position of the reattachment line .\par
  the flow in the region between the leading edge and\par
the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics\par
analogous to those found upstream of the shock on\par
two-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward\par
shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low\par
supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about\par
a simple cone .\par
  the general flow development is related in the\par
text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag .\par
the first two are most affected by the aft movement\par
of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic\par
drag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be\par
influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation\par
and possibly also by some stage in the development\par
of the forward shock .\par
  the flow over the cropped-delta planform is\par
noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock\par
and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and\par
partly to the unswept trailing edge .  a comparison is made\par
with results obtained during preliminary tests in\par
which the wing planform closely resembled that of a true\par

addition to the case of no forced injection .  pressure\par
distribution measurements were made along the nonpermeable diverging\par
boundary .  it was found that flow separation at expansion ratios\par
approaching the optimum value for maximum thrust coefficient\par
could be induced at the porous wall by a local injection mass\par
velocity of the order of a few per cent of the local main-stream\par
mass velocity .  separation at the solid boundary was not\par
noticeably influenced by injection at the opposite wall, and the\par
asymmetrical separation thus effected jet deflections of up to 10\par
degrees at the lower stagnation-pressure levels .  variation of the\par
wall heat-transfer condition by changing the stagnation\par
temperature did not significantly influence separation behavior .\par

section, together with use of published correlations and of the\par

heat transfer through the laminar boundary layer on\par
a circular cylinder in axial incompressible flow .\par
  this paper presents a method of calculating\par
the distribution of rate of heat transfer\par
into a laminar incompressible boundary layer\par
from the exterior surface of a long thin\par
circular cylinder, when the surface of the\par
cylinder is maintained at a constant\par
temperature and the flow is parallel to the\par
cylinder axis,. the temperature difference\par
between the surface and the main stream\par
is taken to be small enough to neglect\par
buoyancy effects .  a series solution, valid\par
for small downstream distances from the\par
nose, has been obtained already by seban,\par
bond, and kelly .  this is now extended\par
by deriving an asymptotic series solution,\par
valid at large downstream distances, and\par
bridging the gap between these two series\par
solutions by an approximate solution,\par
based on the method used recently by davies\par
and bourne to calculate heat transfer\par
from a flat plate .  the calculation is used to\par
demonstrate the effect of curvature\par
and of prandtl number on the local rate of heat\par
transfer at various downstream\par
distances by comparing with the corresponding flat plate results .\par

 of the motion and for a wide variety of shapes of the cylinder\par

force per unit area which is the same as that for a flat plate of\par

a wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotary\par
stability derivatives at subsonic and supersonic speeds .\par
a method is described for measuring the dynamic stability derivatives\par
of a model airplane in a wind tunnel .  the characteristic features\par
of this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations were\par
used to obtain combinations of rolling, yawing and pitching motions.,\par
that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedback\par
which permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for more\par
conventional types of oscillatory testing., and that data processing was\par
greatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gage\par
circuitry .\par
the system described is primarily for measurement of the damping\par
derivatives damping\par
in roll damping in pitch, damping in yaw, and the cross derivatives\par
rolling moment due to yawing and yawing moment due to rolling .  the\par
method of testing also permits measurement under oscillatory conditions\par
of the static derivatives rolling moment due to sideslip, yawing moment\par
due to sideslip, and pitching moment due to angle of attack .  all these\par
derivatives are of particular importance in estimating the short-period\par
oscillatory motions of a rigid airplane .\par
a small number of experimental data are included to illustrate the\par
general scope of results obtainable with this system .\par

some low speed problems of high speed aircraft .\par
the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of\par
aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international\par
congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for\par
achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody\par
arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and\par
streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low\par
supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading\par
edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more .\par
no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable\par
geometry .\par
in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of\par
 flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it\par
 is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the\par
knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are\par
described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control\par
methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground\par
effect on maximum lift .\par
more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use\par
involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow\par
and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of\par
the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static\par
longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of\par
 available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments\par
due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control,\par
and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional\par
stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed .\par
finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised .\par
the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying\par
some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it\par
is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of\par
these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants .\par
two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some\par
detail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an\par
avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are\par
described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the\par
piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort .\par
 some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and\par
phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn .\par
a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling\par
requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .\par

tunnel of the effects of leading-edge modifications on the flow and\par
forces on an untapered wing of 50 deg leading-edge sweep, at stream mach\par
 numbers between 0 60 and 1 20 . seven leading-edge profiles were\par
tested, ranging from a drooped extension of 18 per cent of the chord of\par
the basic sharp-nosed section to a round-nosed section with a\par
leading-edge radius of 1 0 per cent of the basic chord .\par
leading-edge droop was found to increase the wing drag near zero lift\par
but to reduce appreciably the lift-dependent drag component, except at\par
the highest test mach numbers . droop also increased the lift\par
coefficient at which leading-edge separation occurred on the upper surface\par
at moderate subsonic speeds, but in addition reduced the mach number for\par
 transonic flow attachment . the appearance of the forward shock /but\par
not the rear shock/ is considerably delayed when the leading edge is\par
drooped .\par
with the undrooped sections an increase in leading-edge radius was\par
accompanied by successively earlier appearances of the forward shock,\par
and hence the outboard shock with its attendant separation . the\par
conditions at which the rear shock first appeared changed only slowly as the\par
section was changed .\par
the variations in wing flow pattern as the leading edge is modified are\par
discussed and related to measured changes in the wing lift and drag .\par
an attempt is also made to estimate the local mach numbers on some parts\par
 of the wing from the oil-flow patterns,. this material is used to\par
assess the flow conditions appropriate to shock-induced separation .\par
the main section of the report concludes with a tentative discussion of\par
the significance of the present results to the design of swept wings .\par
in an appendix results obtained with the wing in a sweptforward\par
configuration are briefly considered .\par

interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the\par
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .\par
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important\par
effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been\par
written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical\par
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying\par
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to\par
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our\par
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a\par
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem\par
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .\par
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types\par
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the\par
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction\par
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of\par
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a\par
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if\par
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of\par
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences\par
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the\par
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers\par
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in\par
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream\par
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the\par
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the\par
surface .\par
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in\par
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of\par
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of\par
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the\par
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and\par
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences\par
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are\par
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and\par
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,\par
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial\par
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of\par
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that\par
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a\par
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and\par
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the\par
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight\par
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a\par
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions\par
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if\par
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and\par
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information\par
 is at present available on this point .\par
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion\par
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated\par
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this\par
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation\par
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge\par
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock\par
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain\par
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface\par
separation .\par
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the\par
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other\par
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .\par
some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of\par
 the paper .\par

some effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests on\par
two-dimensional aerofoils at high subsonic and transonic speeds .\par
in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national\par
physical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum,\par
 in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects\par
experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the\par
risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .\par
this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working\par
sections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect\par
corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height\par
normally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open\par
area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant\par
proportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number\par
separated flows . the observed trends in the variation of the blockage\par
effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from\par
those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more\par
 generally until these trends have been checked by further\par
investigations .\par
it is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly\par
influence the manner in which separated flows develop with increasing\par
incidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open area .\par
examples are also given of effects of distortions in the local\par
supersonic flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively large\par
open areas .\par

tests have been made in three n.p.l. wind tunnels on a pressure-plotting\par
 model consisting of a long cylinder with a hemispherical nose . the\par
surface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbers\par
between 0.7 and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs\par
were taken . the blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120( .\par
the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size\par
on the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model\par
with increasing stream mach number . this is thought to depend mainly\par
on the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel,\par
and not necessarily on the blockage ratio . the distance of the solid\par
sidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the\par
terminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near\par

experimental study of the equivalence of transonic\par
flow about slender cone-cylinders of circular and elliptic\par
cross section .\par
  this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence\par
relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by\par
transonic slender-body theory .  the models chosen for this study are a\par
flat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of\par
revolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flows\par
about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the\par
theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to\par
cone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of\par
approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares\par
favorably with jones' slender-wing theory .\par
  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and\par
at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic\par
characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use\par
of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent\par
body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate\par
nonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced\par
that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that\par
required for the successful application of the transonic area rule .\par

a theory is developed of the supersonic flow past a body of revolution\par

it is used to find the asymptotic forms of the equations of the shocks\par

a flight test investigation of the sonic boom .\par
  the /sonic boom/ as it is now popularly called, has become the\par
center of considerable interest during the past few years because of\par
widespread public disturbance and possible damage that can result\par
from it .  in the hopes of minimizing this disturbance and to extend\par
the general knowledge of the shock waves which produce the booming\par
noise, the aeronautical research laboratory, wright air development\par
center, has initiated an extensive research program to study the sonic\par
boom phenomenon .\par
  this report presents the results of flight tests undertaken as one\par
phase of this program .  the tests had as their objective the\par
determination and measurement of the shock wave pressure pattern surrounding\par
an f-100 aircraft in level supersonic flight .\par
  the flight tests were conducted at the air force flight test\par
center, edwards air force base, california, under the authority of air\par

  the measured and calculated values of the pressure rise across the\par
shock wave were generally in good agreement .  there is a tendency for\par
the theory to overestimate the pressure at locations remote from the\par

at altitude .  the measured values of ground-reflection factor averaged\par
about 1.8 for the surfaces tested as compared to a theoretical value\par
of 2.0 .  two booms were measured in all cases .  the observers also\par
generally reported two booms,. although, in some cases, only one boom\par
was reported .  the shock-wave noise associated with some of the flight\par
tests was judged to be objectionable by ground observers, and in one\par

supersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber are\par
presented .\par
  level cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet and a mach\par
number of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to be\par
tolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher\par
altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the\par
size and weight of the test airplanes .  the measured variation of\par
sonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the\par
variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48 .\par
  the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between\par
mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0, a result in agreement with the theory .  no\par
amplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effects\par
was apparent near the cutoff mach number .\par
  a method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoff\par
mach number is shown .  experimental results indicate agreement with the\par
method, since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreased\par
intensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at\par

  this paper is a brief summary of\par
an investigation made to check the effect of lift\par
on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic\par
speeds .  the method of hayes has been\par
combined with the theory of whitham to\par
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings\par
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies\par
and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as\par
general, method was derived by walkden in\par
ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the\par
volume term, has been used extensively to predict\par
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies\par
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,\par
been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained\par
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.\par
altitude and the calculations of this paper show\par
that under those conditions the shock noise of\par
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,\par
be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown\par
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will\par
dominate for even the small fighter and they will\par
dominate over most of the altitude range\par
for large bomber and supersonic transport\par
aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases\par
with altitude as which compares to\par
in the volume case (=pressure at\par
altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,\par
wing loading, wing plan shape and\par
lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating\par
the shock noise due to combined volume and\par
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to\par
configurations with wings located towards the\par
rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock\par
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal\par
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)\par
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting\par
volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is\par
presented from which rapid estimates can be\par
made of the shock noise of lifting\par
wing-body combinations .\par

investigation of several blunt bodies to determine\par
trans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects\par

  several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for\par
atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic\par
characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 .  the tests\par
were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds\par
numbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .\par
  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed\par
the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve\par
slopes .  the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears\par
to be subject to mach number effects .  spinning a full-skirted body\par
about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the\par
pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static\par
stability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  the\par
extension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a\par
short-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability\par
only if the flaps extended into the airstream .\par
  some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two\par
dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach\par
number in these tests .  there is doubt, however, that these pressures\par
can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle\par
because of their small amplitude and phasing .\par

theories of plastic buckling .\par
  the theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appears\par
finally to have achieved a satisfactory form, rests upon the\par
well-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development of\par
a correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of\par
plates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established\par
polyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .\par
  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond\par
the elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow\par
and deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based on\par
deformation theories are in better agreement with experiment\par
than those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests in\par
which a material is compressed into the plastic range and then\par
subjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better\par
agreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimate\par
doubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for\par
the plastic buckling of plates .\par
  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a new\par
theory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the\par
flow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept of\par
slip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less\par
by mathematical, considerations than previous theories .\par
experimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in\par
better agreement with the new theory than with either flow or\par
deformation theories .  the new theory accounts for the apparent\par
contradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use of\par
deformation theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .\par

  von karman and tsien have shown that under elastic\par
conditions the resistance of perfect thin cylinders\par

buckling .  it is considered that this indicates that this type of\par
buckling is very sensitive to imperfections or disturbances .\par
in this paper the effects of certain imperfections of shape\par
turbances combined) are studied by the large-deflection\par
shell theory developed in a previous paper (2) .\par
  it is found that two types of buckling failure may occur .\par
one is of a purely elastic type which occurs when the peak\par
of the average stress versus average strain curve is reached,\par
while the other type is precipitated by yielding, which for\par
thicker cylinders or lower-yield material may occur before\par
such a peak is reached .  curves are derived giving the\par

elastic and yield properties of the specimen and also upon\par
an /unevenness factor/ u which determines the\par
magnitude of the initial imperfections and is assumed to depend\par
on the method of fabrication .  the relations derived are in\par
line with test results, and similar studies of the buckling\par
of struts indicate that the magnitude of the initial\par

are reasonable .\par

inelastic instability and incremental theories of plasticity .\par
  a most troublesome paradox has existed for a number of years\par
with respect to buckling in the plastic range .  theoretical\par
considerations and all direct experimental evidence show\par
conclusively that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theory\par
of plasticity is valid .  however, the results of plastic buckling\par
tests are well correlated by a simple total or deformation theory\par
and bear no resemblance to published predictions of incremental\par
theory .\par
  the suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shape\par
or loading might well explain this most peculiar result .\par
however, subsequent investigations by several authors seem to have\par
given the impression that excessively large imperfections would\par
be needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to the\par
magnitude of such imperfections .\par
  it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely\par
small, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do\par
account for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load is\par
shown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection .\par
the example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangular\par
plate hinged along one edge and free on the other under\par
uniform compressive stress at the ends .  this is the equivalent of\par
the case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbing\par
in the past because incremental theory applied to a perfect\par
cruciform column did lead to an entirely incorrect result .\par

small bending and stretching of sandwich type shells .\par
  a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of\par
sandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory\par
of homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are\par
important in the present problem, which have not been considered\par
previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of\par
transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress\par
deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of\par
importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was\par
found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no\par
counterpart in flat-plate theory .\par
  the general results of this report have been applied to the\par
solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular\par
cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical\par
examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects\par
of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .\par
  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of\par
taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type\par
shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between\par
the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the\par
composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse\par
shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to\par
be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse\par
core flexibility .\par
  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the\par
geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration\par
so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic\par
modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .\par
  solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be\par
obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed\par
in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse\par
shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does\par
not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .\par

a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin\par
elastic shallow spherical shells .\par
  a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure\par
for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at\par
relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one\par
for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in\par
the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for\par
structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question\par
arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the\par
classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to\par
infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy\par
criterion/ proposed by tsien .\par
  in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling\par
of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and\par
experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations\par
are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of\par
the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the\par
coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome\par
is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its\par
thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge\par
rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load\par
according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t,\par
convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the\par
buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however\par
even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined\par
for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs .\par
these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t\par
increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied,\par
the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .\par
  experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion\par
of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the\par
theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for\par
higher domes is also indicated .\par

stresses and small displacements of shallow spherical\par
shells .\par
  the purpose of the present paper is to derive a system of\par
equations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments of\par
thin, elastic, spherical shells .  a segment will be called shallow if\par
the ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, say .  the\par
results obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also be\par
applicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loads\par
are such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zones .\par
  the problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject of\par
numerous researches .  for the rotationally symmetric case the\par
fundamental results were obtained in 1912 (1) and have been the starting\par
point of many applications .  while it is possible to deduce from these\par
results approximate equations equivalent to part of what follows, it is\par
believed that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell\par
may be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric cases .\par
  a number of investigations have been concerned with the shell loaded\par
in a non-rotationally symmetric manner (2,3,4) .  in its general form\par
this problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are not\par
easy to apply .  restricting attention to the shallow shell in the\par
manner of the present paper brings with it a very considerable\par
simplification of the analysis .\par

flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindrical\par
shells having freely supported ends .\par
the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thin\par
cylinders and a theoretical and experimental investigation is made of\par
the type of vibration usually associated with bells .  the cylinders are\par
supported in such a manner that the ends remain circular without\par
directional restraint being imposed .  it is found that the complexity\par
of the mode of vibration bears little relation to the natural\par
frequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameter\par
ratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may have\par
many of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes of\par
vibration .  the frequency equation which is derived by the energy\par
method is based on strain relations given by timoshenko .  in this\par
approach, displacement equations are evolved which are comparable to\par
those of love and flugge, though differences are evident due to the\par
strain expressions used by each author .  results are given for\par
cylinders of various lengths, each with the same thickness-diameter\par
ratio, and also for a very thin cylinder in which the simpler modes of\par
vibration occur in the higher frequency range .  it is shown that there\par
are three possible natural frequencies for a particular nodal pattern,\par
two of these normally occurring beyond the aural range .\par

the flexural vibrations of thin cylinders .\par
the flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylinders are considered .\par
in this type of vibration many forms of nodal pattern may exist owing to\par
the combination of circumferential and axial nodes .  theoretical\par
expressions are developed for the natural frequencies of cylinders with\par
freely-supported and fixed ends and a comparison is made with the\par
frequencies obtained experimentally .\par
  in practice, the ends of cylinders are subjected to a certain degree\par
of fixing by end-plates, flanges, etc., and the natural frequencies thus\par
lie between the corresponding values for freely-supported and fixed\par
ends .  to make possible the estimation of such frequencies, a method is\par
devised in which an equivalent wavelength factor is used .  this factor\par
represents the wavelength of the freely-supported cylinder that would\par
have the same frequency as the cylinder under consideration when\par
vibrating in the same mode .  the results of experimental investigations\par
with various end thicknesses and flange dimensions are recorded, and\par
from these the equivalent factors are derived .\par
  sets of curves calculated for cylinders with freely-supported ends and\par
covering a range of cylinder thicknesses are given .  from these it is\par
possible to obtain close approximation to the frequencies of cylinders\par
under other end conditions by the use of an appropriate factor .  an\par
example is given of frequency calculations for a large air-receiver for\par
which two frequencies were identified by experiment .\par

on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal\par
pressure .\par
  the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled\par
circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered .\par
it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure\par
has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics .\par
for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to\par
diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency\par
is in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number of\par
circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated\par
with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p .\par
if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p\par
when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest\par
frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal\par
pressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequency\par
spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the\par
frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential\par
nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal\par
pressure .\par
  experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration\par
modes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinders\par
subjected to internal pressure are briefly described .  these\par
results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's\par

some experimental studies of panel flutter at mach\par
1 .3.\par
  experimental studies of panel flutter were conducted at a mach\par
number of 1.3 to verify the existence of this phenomenon and to study the\par
effects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristics .\par
thin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and were\par
mounted as a section of the tunnel wall .  most of the data were obtained by\par
using aluminum-alloy panels, although a few steel, magnesium, and brass\par
panels were also used .  different materials with various thicknesses\par
and lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters on\par
panel flutter .  the experimental program consisted of three phases ..\par
panels clamped front and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on all\par
four edges .\par
  panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions\par
and it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasing\par
tensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as were\par
shortening the panels or increasing the bending stiffness .  no apparent\par
systematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed,\par
and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved higher\par
modes and frequencies .  the presence of a pressure differential between\par
the two surfaces of a panel was observed to have a stabilizing effect .\par
initially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panels\par
without buckling .  buckled panels with all four edges clamped were much\par
less prone to flutter than buckled panels clamped front and rear .\par

expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral\par
directions .\par
  a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points\par
consisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and a\par
transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries .  in the region\par
where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel\par
skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more\par
susceptible to flutter .  in the region where a panel must be buckled\par
when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed .  this reversal in\par
trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .\par

  all panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increase\par
in panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermally\par
induced stress prior to buckling .  after buckling the panels showed\par
flutter boundaries characterized by a decrease in thickness required to\par
prevent flutter with further increases in thermal stress .  the largest\par
thickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamic\par
heating occurred at the transition between the flat-panel boundary and\par
the buckled-panel boundary .  this peak value (for aluminum-alloy panel)\par
was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for an\par

fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise\par

  boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a\par
sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow .  it is\par
shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial\par
distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall\par
temperature by an angle of 30 to 45 .  this leads to the\par
conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the\par
temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer\par
coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept .\par
the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the\par
temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion .  the distortion\par
is measured by the peclet number .  approximate equations\par
representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis\par
and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined\par
with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength .  a\par
solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity\par
profile which is not a straight line .  the use of previously developed\par

the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds .\par
the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter\par
speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is\par
therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for\par
the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is\par
necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small\par
suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a\par
reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in\par
most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted\par
at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present\par
paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the\par
critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make\par
the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to\par
reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the\par
critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities\par
may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model .\par
the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter\par
speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected\par
 by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are\par
equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are\par
the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less\par
 than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that\par
the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail\par
in a flutter .\par
lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is\par
negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model .\par
gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation\par
 of the model .\par

  the requirements for simulating in a wind tunnel flutter conditions\par
appropriate to high-speed flight are discussed, and an assessment is\par
made of the desirable features of a wind tunnel suitable for flutter\par
testing at transonic and supersonic speeds .\par
  it is concluded that such a tunnel should have either the mach number\par
or the stagnation pressure variable during the tunnel run, and that it\par
is of considerable advantage, and for some purposes essential, for high\par
stagnation pressures to be available .  the stagnation pressure required\par
to allow flight conditions to be simulated with a flutter model is\par
considered to range from at least 2 atmospheres for transonic speeds to\par
about 15 atmospheres for m = 4 .  no attempt to simulate kinetic heating\par
is envisaged, although its effect on stiffness should be allowed for in\par
the design of the model .  to minimise uncertainties due to the\par
variation of the model stiffness with temperature it is desirable that\par
means for controlling the stagnation temperature should be incorporated\par

  in part 1, the equation for the equilibrium of cylindrical\par
shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to find\par
the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find\par
critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under\par
other loading conditions .  it is shown that by this method\par
solutions may be obtained very easily and the results in each case may\par
be expressed in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one\par
dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially\par
determined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of boundary\par
conditions related to edge displacements in the shell median\par
surface is discussed .  the accuracy of the solutions found is\par
established by comparing them with previous theoretical solutions\par

interpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the case\par

aerodynamic effects on boundary layer unsteadiness .\par
  with a view to the study of\par
aerodynamic problems, a review is made\par
of boundary layer theory for a flat\par
plate moving with a time-dependent\par
velocity .  unsteady effects are shown\par
to enter according to the magnitude\par
of the ratio of time for diffusion to act\par
throughout the boundary layer to the\par
characteristic time of the imposed unsteadiness .\par
  it is concluded that a boundary layer\par

  the practical need for research\par
into the aerodynamics of\par
slender delta wings in unsteady motion has\par
been emphasized in a recent\par
paper by zbrozek .  two important aspects\par
are ..  -      formation and presence of\par
      leading-edge vortices .\par
      with oscillatory or transient\par
      modes of longitudinal (or\par
      chordwise) bending .\par
  the first of the aspects\par
above, has already been briefly\par
discussed in ref. 2 .  one feature of\par
the flow with leading-edge vortices\par
which seems to be of particular\par
significance to the dynamic behaviour\par
of a wing is the shedding of vorticity\par
at the leading edge as well as at\par
the trailing edge .  any time-dependent\par
motion, or distortion, of the wing\par
leads to a change in the rate at which\par
vorticity is shed .  with more\par
conventional types of flow, the free\par
vorticity being shed only from the\par
trailing edge has diminishing influence\par
on the wing, but when the free\par
vorticity is shed from the leading edge,\par
in passing downstream, it\par
remains close to the upper surface of the\par
wing .  it might be expected\par
then, that, although the magnitudes of the\par
unsteady forces may not be\par
greatly affected for a slender delta, the\par
time delays associated with\par
the forces may be significantly different\par
for the attached and\par
separated regimes of leading-edge flow .\par

shock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil .  for\par
the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations\par
technique is employed and the interaction with the shock\par
wave is taken into account .  the case of an oscillating\par
aileron is considered first, and a solution is derived\par
for the pressure distribution on the aileron .  it is\par
found that the solution has a simple form when the\par
shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the\par
aileron .  as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a\par
correction must be added to the solution .  an\par
interpretation of these results is given .  the results are\par
compared with results of a theory which neglects the\par
presence of the shock and it is found that both agree\par
for m = 1 .  for m   1, however, neglecting the presence\par
of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of\par
magnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number\par
behind the shock .\par
  the theory is finally extended to include the case\par
in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the\par
solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is\par
treated .  the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer\par
interaction is discussed and it is shown that this\par
mechanism can be included in the results of the present\par

early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institute of hydraulic research\par
undertook the design and fabrication of a variable-pressure water\par
tunnel .  as the tunnel neared completion, however, its immediate use\par
for the study of the pressure distribution around various body forms\par
was requested .\par
the original request for this investigation was a natural out-growth\par
of the need for systematic data on the distribution of pressure\par
in flow around various bodies, particularly under conditions leading to\par
cavitation, information which is desirable for the design of a wide\par
variety of navy equipment .  ultimately the study is to include data\par
for two- and three-dimensional head and tail forms at various angles of\par
yaw .  the first phase of the study, namely the investigation of\par
three-dimensional head forms at zero angle of yaw, is described herein .\par

ellipsoidal, and conical.dash together with other related forms .\par
the data obtained have been systematized to yield information for\par
a wide variety of geometrical forms either directly or by\par
interpolation .  whenever possible, analytical methods have been used to\par
corroborate the experimental data and to provide a reliable means\par

  random vibration is vibration which results\par
from an excitation which is not well represented by any simple\par
function (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination of\par
such functions but which is satisfactorily modeled by a\par
stochastic process .  it is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration\par
to say that /all vibration is random vibration ./  every\par
vibration record contains /hash/ at some level .  nevertheless,\par
until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able to\par
get along without including the consideration of random\par
excitations .\par
  now in several fields simultaneously there has occurred a\par
burst of activity in the application of random processes .  the\par
response of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulence\par
and the response of ships to confused seas have been put on\par
reasonably firm footing .  possibly the most dramatic problems\par
have been posed by the development of large jet and rocket\par
engines which produce spectacular amounts of random\par
vibrational energy .  the high level of random vibration in a jet\par

the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic\par

when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio,\par
 and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shown\par
that the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbation\par
potential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation .\par
the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation in\par
the free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developed\par
by adams and sears for steady flow . the method gives solutions valid\par
for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency .\par
the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid\par
 and elastic modes . from the results it can be seen that the special\par
non-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in\par
slender-body theory, are very important . stability derivatives can also\par
 be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may\par
be negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .\par

a method of calculating the short period longitudinal\par
stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady\par
compressible flow .\par
  a method is developed for the\par
calculation of the pressure\par
distribution and the aerodynamic forces and\par
moments on a wing performing harmonic\par
pitching and heaving oscillations .\par
the calculation is based on the\par
assumption of inviscid potential flow\par
without shock waves and is\par
restricted to small incidence, so that the\par
linearized theory is valid .\par
  in contrast to other work in the\par
field the theory applies to all\par
mach numbers .  it is restricted to small\par
values of the reduced frequency\par
and should be valid for the usual range\par
of short periods occurring at\par
present in flight .  the formal solution\par
yields two integral equations for\par
the parts of the load, which are in phase\par
and go out of phase with the\par
oscillation,. these are of the same form\par
as the corresponding equation\par
in steady flow .\par
  the way is thus opened for solutions\par
over the whole mach number\par
range at small frequencies, if the\par
corresponding steady solutions can\par
be found .  the calculation is in fact\par
easiest for m = 1 and has been\par
done here for delta-wings to supplement\par
a previous supersonic calculation,\par
made on different frequency assumptions,\par
which broke down near m = 1 .\par
it appears from the two sets of results\par
that the short period oscillation\par
will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex\par
angle of the delta wing is\par
greater than about 60 .  this confirms a\par
now generally recognised trend .\par
  such results near m = 1 must of\par
course be invalidated to an\par
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and\par
shock waves at their maximum\par
effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that\par
these factors will remove\par
the critical nature of the transonic damping\par
as calculated by this method .\par
with all its obvious limitations this method,\par
when extended to other\par
planforms, should provide a useful tool in\par
studying the effect of\par
geometrical parameters on the stability of\par
an aircraft at transonic\par
speeds .\par

investigation of normal force distributions and wake\par
vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic\par

  the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies\par
of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in\par
order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex\par
wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing\par
interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal\par
force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local\par
flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are\par
discussed and analyzed .\par
  comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and\par
center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with\par
theories which include methods for estimating the effects of\par
viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly\par
dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack .\par
further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and\par
experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that,\par
in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing\par
theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and\par
distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .\par
  the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the\par
circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body\par
vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter\par
integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet .\par
the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in\par
close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength\par
formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is\par
assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical\par
portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible\par
potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of\par
equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however,\par
in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex\par
locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined\par
from experiment .\par
  the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are,\par
in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned\par
incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination\par
angles which are in good agreement with the measured values,\par
except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,\par
and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are\par
expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple\par
methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to\par
substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and\par
experiment .\par
  it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be\par
adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions\par
represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the\par
distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are\par
accurately known .\par

.W\par
a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under\par
axial compression and bending .\par
  the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical\par
shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and\par
too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good\par
agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the\par
assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal\par
deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6\par
to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently\par
considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens\par
than for duralumin and increases with the radius-\par
thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between\par
observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .\par
  in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is\par
developed, which permits initial eccentricities or\par
deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true\par
instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,.\par
the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is\par
assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum\par
stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial\par
eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for\par
the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial\par
eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,.\par
however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be\par
explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are\par
assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and\par
if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the\par
magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with\par
these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a\par
function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of\par
elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this\par
a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves\par
relations suggested by the theory but is based on\par
experimental data .\par
  it is shown that similar discrepancies between\par
experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin\par
cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the\par
same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can\par
be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation\par
buckling problems can probably be explained by similar\par
considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may\par
help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems .\par
the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should\par
be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other\par
applications as well .\par
  the paper presents the results of about a hundred new\par
tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending,\par
which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form\par
the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .\par

the report is a first attempt to devise a calculation method\par
for representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells\par
of variable curvature .  the problem occurs, for instance, in\par
dimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which is\par
decisively influenced by the variability of curvature .  the\par
calculation is made possible by simplifying the stability\par
equations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) and\par
by assuming that the curvature as a function of the arc\par

the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed\par
for two-dimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils .\par
  advances in the practical development of boundary-layer\par
control for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn\par
attention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to\par
artificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window\par
panels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impact\par
with insects .  this natural form of roughening, the effects of which\par
have been noted, though not investigated previously, is the\par
subject of the present paper .\par
  the phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely,\par
and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary\par
layer .  wind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila,\par
and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and\par
airfoils are fully described .  the former problem has also been\par
treated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published,\par
agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in\par
all essentials .\par
  the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally\par
of a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an\par
extensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced and\par
gradually diminishing value of the excrescence height .  further,\par
it is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effect\par
upon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the\par
down-stream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of a\par
laminar layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically\par
smooth .  moreover, it appears that the conditions defining the\par
upstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are\par
fundamentally the same as those which determine the critical\par
state for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three-\par
dimensional character .\par

through the pre-asymptotic turbulent free shear layer in two-dimensional\par
incompressible flow is resolved into two parts .  the linearized\par

exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward\par

  the effect of a forward-facing jet on\par
the bow shock of a blunt body in a\par
mach 6 free stream was investigated\par
experimentally .  the models tested had\par
forward-facing jets using air and helium exhausting\par
at mach numbers from 1 to 10.3 and\par
were run through a range of the ratio of jet\par
total pressure to free-stream total\par
pressure of 0.03 (jet off) to 2.5 .  the ratio\par
of body diameter to jet-exit\par
diameter varied from 1.12 to 55.6 and the angle\par
of attack was varied from 0 to 35 .\par
  the experimental results show that the\par
main-stream shock can be affected by\par
the jet in two significantly different ways .\par
one way is simply to move the strong\par
shock away from the body without altering its\par
shape .  the second and perhaps more\par
interesting case occurs when the jet causes a\par
large displacement of the main shock\par
and considerably changes its shape .  it was\par
found that the ratio of jet total\par
pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary\par
to obtain the large displacements\par
of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio\par
of body diameter to jet-exit\par
diameter and also on the jet-exit mach number .  the\par
maximum amount the shock could be\par
displaced in percent of body diameter was seen\par
to increase with increasing\par
jet-exit mach number and also with decreasing ratio\par
of body diameter to jet-exit\par
diameter .  for the models that were investigated\par
through an angle-of-attack range, the\par
displacement became very unsteady and fell off\par
sharply as the angle of attack was\par
increased .\par
  simplified theoretical considerations applied\par
to the shock-displacement\par
phenomena provide a possible explanation for the\par
two different types of\par
main-stream shock displacement .  theoretical curves\par
show the regions where these types\par
of displacement would occur for different exit\par

afterbody was statically stable in the\par
nose-forward attitude only, whereas the\par

statically stable in both the nose-forward\par

reasonably well by modified\par

except the pitching-moment coefficient\par
for the model without afterbody near 180\par

an approximation to the heat transfer rate across a laminar\par

using the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the\par
coefficients in a manner which is most closely correct near the\par
surface .  the heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l\par
breadth is given as\par
where k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number,\par
p its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction,\par
and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature .\par
a critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very\par
accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the\par
constant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed\par

r and the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the\par
case of uniform wall temperature .\par
however, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the\par
original formula is accurate to within 3 percent even for .  by\par
known transformations an expression is deducted for heat\par
transfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution\par
along it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary\par
mach number (equation (42)) .  from this the temperature distribution\par
along such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach\par
numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation\par
from it .  this calculation, which includes the solution of a non-linear\par
integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose,\par
and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory\par
which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat\par
transfer balance .  this effect will be considerably mitigated\par
for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not\par
in a position to say whether or not it will be appreciable for\par
metal projectiles .  but for stony meteorites at a certain stage\par
of their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that\par
melting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for\par
which the shape and constitution of a few of them affords evidence .\par
an appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving\par
von mises's equation could be used to determine the skin friction\par
as well as heat transfer rate, but this line seems to have no advantage\par

on fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, and\par
effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces .\par
an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,\par
and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several\par
limitations on such streams .\par
in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force\par
liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure\par
gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in\par
the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same\par
boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which\par
agrees closely with machine calculations .\par
in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large\par
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due\par
 to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be\par
negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are\par
separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature\par
variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional\par
heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the\par
constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for\par
free-convection flows/ considered by many authors .\par
finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise\par
variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the\par
independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise\par
velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the\par
channel, a solution is given .\par

turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body\par
at hypersonic speeds .\par
  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10\par
corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid\par
wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed\par
body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion\par
and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed\par
by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from\par
the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the\par
surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows\par
enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer\par
inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it\par
behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/\par
wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial\par
value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of\par
the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight\par
velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the\par
turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar\par
turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements\par
of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the\par
region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .\par
tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the\par
wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed\par
case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .\par
  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as\par
electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the\par
two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure\par
diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for\par
m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the\par
case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent\par
radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300\par
mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for\par
uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the\par
width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma\par
requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body\par
diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .\par
these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider\par
including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion\par
recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete\par
picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .\par

a method is presented for analysis of the compressible flow between the\par
hub and the shroud of mixed-flow impellers of arbitrary design . axial\par
symmetry was assumed, but the forces in the meridional /hub to shroud/\par
plane, which are derived from tangential pressure gradients, were taken\par
into account .\par
the method was applied to an experimental mixed-flow impeller . the\par
analysis of the flow in the meridional plane of the impeller showed that\par
 the rotational forces, the blade curvature, and the hub-shroud profile\par
can introduce severe velocity gradients along the hub and the shroud\par
surfaces . choked flow at the impeller inlet as determined by the\par

three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and\par
skewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure\par
 to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet .\par
all original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained .\par
experimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had better\par
performance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds\par
investigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per\par
second and higher . these large gains probably resulted primarily from\par
more favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers\par
further away from the condition necessary for eddy formation . the\par
modified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range of\par
weight flows at high speeds .\par
the modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalent\par
speeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the\par
 point of incipient surge . at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure\par
ratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the\par
parabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively . for the same\par
conditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed\par
 impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737\par
 and 0.805, respectively . of the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller\par
had the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best\par
weight-flow range over the speed range tested . on the basis of the\par
parameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior\par
to circular blading . the experimental results indicate that the design\par

a general theory of steady three-dimensional flow of a nonviscous fluid\par
in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub and casing\par

 three-dimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained by\par
investigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaces\par
whose intersections with a z-plane either upstream of or somewhere\par
inside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial line . the equations\par
obtained to describe the fluid flow on these stream surfaces show\par
clearly the several approximations involved in ordinary two-dimensional\par
treatments . they also lead to a solution of the three-dimensional\par
problem in a mathematically two-dimensional manner through iteration .\par
the equation of continuity is combined with the equation of motion in\par
either the tangential or the radial direction through the use of a\par
stream function defined on the surface, and the resulting equation is\par
chosen as the principal equation for such flows . the character of this\par
equation depends on the relative magnitude of the local velocity of\par
sound and a certain combination of velocity components of the fluid . a\par
general method to solve this equation by both hand and high-speed\par

the nonviscous flow through a mixed-flow pump impeller having one\par

blade-to-blade surface of revolution using a previously reported\par
analysis method . solutions were obtained for a variety of flow\par
conditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to the\par
flow upstream of the impeller .\par
the velocity distributions on the main-blade surfaces and on the\par
splitter-vane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were strongly\par
dependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation points .\par
solutions were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of\par
 flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of the\par
rear stagnation points . these solutions indicated that the velocity\par
distributions in the splitter-vane region are largely determined by the\par
division of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region in\par
the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slip\par
factor .\par

a study was made at transonic speeds by the naca wing-flow method of the\par
 pressure-drag reduction obtained by projecting a high-energy jet of air\par
 from the nose of a prolate spheroid . supplementary information was\par
obtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted in a small\par
supersonic tunnel at a constant mach number of 1.5 .\par
the high-velocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distribution\par
over the body in such a way that the pressure drag of the body was\par
reduced,. thus, in a restricted sense, the nose jet produced a thrust on\par
 the body . under the conditions investigated, the thrust produced by\par
the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected from a\par
conventional rearward jet . for example, under the best conditions\par
tested /mach number of 1.07/ the reduction in body pressure drag caused\par
by the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet\par
 itself . however, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in\par
 body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust of\par
the jet/ was only about one-half of the thrust which would be produced\par
by the same jet exhausting rearward . the appearance of such an\par

an investigation has been made at a mach number of 1.62 to determine\par
the effects of a small jet of air exhausting from the nose of an\par
elliptical body of revolution upon boundary-layer transition and the\par
viscous, pressure, and total drag of the forebody at three body stations\par
body nose were also obtained . the tests were conducted at reynolds\par
numbers of 2.13 x 10 and 7.66 x 10, based on body length . the maximum\par
range of thrust coefficients for the small jet was from 0 to about\par
at the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer was\par
laminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition, a very small flow\par
 from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of\par
the 20-percent-body station . as the jet flow was increased, the\par
transition point moved abruptly to the nose at a thrust coefficient of about\par
gardless of the type of boundary layer . at the higher test reynolds\par
number for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet-off\par
 condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat\par
 by the action of the jet .\par
although the forward-exhausting small jet was found to have the above\par
favorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed too\par
important since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small\par
 jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional manner .\par
no attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the present\par
investigation, yet, from a general consideration of the benefits\par
indicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the\par
vicinity of rearward-exhausting jets, the benefits of a small jet\par
exhausting rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet\par
exhausting forward, particularly so when the flow over the body is\par
laminar in the jet-off condition .\par

 of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel, have\par
investigated the effect of varying spike lengths for flat-faced and\par
hemispherically-nosed axially symmetric bodies . detailed pressure distributions\par
have been obtained as well as heat-transfer rates .\par
these exploratory studies have shown that the use of a spike protruding\par
from a hemispherical-nosed cylinder at m 14 decreased the pressure\par
level by an order of magnitude and the heat transfer to a fraction of\par
that measured on a hemisphere without a spike . the general technique\par

  the possibility of a gradual instability\par
failure of a column under\par
compressive load has been recognized\par
for some time .  marin presented an\par
analysis of creep buckling based on\par
a theory of creep bending, but did not\par

due to axial loading .  the theory also\par
neglected the transient (nonlinear)\par
portion of the creep curve .\par
  in efficient column design, the\par
average stress should be relatively high in\par
comparison with the bending stresses,.\par
that is, the column should be as straight\par
as possible and the slenderness ratio\par
should not be too great .  under these\par
conditions marin's theory is not\par

  published work on creep buckling has implied that failure\par
of columns after a critical time is caused by initial imperfections .\par
such analyses are relatively complex and ultimately leave the\par
choice of selecting the proper value of the initial imperfection to\par
the designer .  furthermore, recent test results on creep buckling\par
of columns have indicated that there is a random and relatively\par
unimportant effect of small initial imperfections on the critical\par
time .\par
  to avoid the difficulties associated with initial imperfections,\par
a formulation of the creep buckling phenomenon in terms of\par
classical stability theory is presented .  the theory permits the\par
extension of known solutions for plastic buckling of certain thin\par
plates and shells to creep buckling problems .\par

  the determination of column deflections and\par
column buckling loads has been considered for\par
many years .  the available theories, however,\par
do not provide for materials which creep with\par
time under constant loads .  for the design of\par
structural members made of these materials, a\par
consideration of creep may be of practical\par
importance .  plastics, concrete, and some metals\par
creep at normal temperatures while other\par
metals creep only at high temperatures and at stress\par
values beyond the yield point .  a consideration\par
of creep in the design of some structures appears\par
appropriate in view of the modern developments\par
in plastics and the presence of high stress values\par
which are sometimes beyond the yield stress .\par
this paper gives a rational theory for predicting\par
creep deflections in columns .  a special case\par

it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for\par
the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial\par
imperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by\par
which failure due to creep occurs after a period of time .  in fact,\par
it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfect\par
column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical\par
load will not buckle at all .  this is an interesting contrast to the\par
case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an\par
insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect\par
column is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfect\par
column .  it is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there is\par
any possible mechanism by which a column containing no initial\par
imperfections can fail as a result of creep when the initial load is\par
less than the theoretical buckling load .\par

column load capacities, is shown to\par
be conservative for the time for which\par

capacity with increasing time .\par
  easily obtained, time-dependent\par
tangent-modulus loads are discussed .\par

to allowable load-capacity\par
estimates .  a limited application is made to\par
test data, and the results\par

of its simplicity .\par

  the general dynamic equation of\par
creep bending of a beam loaded\par

linearly viscoelastic material whose\par
mechanical properties can be characterized\par
by four parameters .  the\par
material can exhibit instantaneous and retarded\par
elasticity as well as pure\par
flow .\par
  the equation derived was used to\par
obtain the creep bending deflection\par
of a beam in pure bending and of a column\par
with initial sinusoidal\par
deviation from straightness .  as expected, the\par
ratio of the creep deflections\par
of the beam in pure bending and the\par
deflections of a corresponding purely\par
elastic structure is identical to the\par
ratio of the creep strain and the\par
corresponding elastic strain of a bar\par
under simple tension or compression .\par
  the results of the analysis of the\par
creep deflection of the column\par
showed that the deflections increase\par
continuously with time and become\par
infinitely large only when the loading\par
time is correspondingly large .\par

constant uniaxial stress, of the form, where is\par
the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b,\par
and k are material constants .  this form was selected because it\par
applies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f .\par
and a low-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f .  however, the\par
analysis is intended for any material having creep properties of the\par
same form and for which the material constants are known .  a\par
strain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary\par
for the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stress\par
properties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses of\par
creep .\par
  the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection\par
approaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite time .\par

modified to yield transient creep curves\par
by assuming that the metal\par
consists of two phases, each with its own\par

extended theory satisfies the basic\par
requirements for a theory of\par
transient creep at elevated temperatures ..\par
that the transient creep be closely\par
connected with the subsequent steady\par
creep, and that the apparent\par
exponent of the time in the transient region\par
be permitted wide variations\par
between 0 and 1 .  from this theory it is\par
possible to construct\par
nondimensional creep curves which extend continuously\par

into the steady-state region .  the\par
corresponding family of creep curves\par
for any metal may be obtained from\par

the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems in\par
instability problems is discussed in reference 1 .  it is shown that,\par
whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determination\par
of instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are valid\par
only for conservative and nongyroscopic systems .  small changes in\par
the character of the loading could make an otherwise conservative\par
system nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of the\par
buckling load .  the buckling load of the cantilever column example\par
in reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that for\par
conservative, constant directional loading .\par

  the stability of a compressed elastic\par
ring has been studied by a method which\par
can be extended to solve the problem\par
of the stability of a flexible heavy structure\par
spread by a system of hoops as in a crinoline\par
skirt .  the original work by levy, which\par
was developed by timoshenko and love,\par
cannot be generalized to problems in\par
which the compressing forces are affected by\par
the deformation of the ring .\par
  it is shown that the load at which a ring\par
will buckle depends not only upon the\par
magnitude of the load but also upon its first\par
derivative relative to the radial distance .\par
a positive derivative causes the ring to\par
buckle at a higher load .  when this result\par
is applied to a cone of heavy and loosely\par
draped fabric spread by a rigid hoop of\par
radius and a larger and flexible hoop\par
of radius below it, both hoops being in\par
horizontal planes, then various modes\par
of buckling other than oval are possible\par
according to the relative magnitudes of\par
and .  it is found that oval buckling\par
changes to three-wave buckling when\par
three-wave changes to\par
four-wave when, and as and\par
approach nearer to equality the buckled\par
form progressively changes to more waves .\par
when applied to a structure spread by\par
many horizontal hoops of which the top\par
one is rigid and oval, it is found that all\par
other hoops, if each is designed to the\par
criterion, will have the same\par
absolute deviation from circularity as the\par
rigid hoop .  if any one hoop is designed\par
so that, then the oval shape of\par
the rigid hoop is magnified on all flexible\par
hoops .\par

to determine the additional\par
stresses arising from discontinuous middle\par
surfaces at the change in\par

  comparisons were made between\par
theoretical and experimental stress\par
distributions for cases with continuous\par

surfaces for radially symmetric changes in\par
wall thickness of a cylinder\par
subject to internal pressure for diameter\par
to larger wall thickness ratios\par
of 117 and 28 and for the case of a\par

thicknesses at the change in wall\par
thickness was 0.4 .\par

  experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer\par
rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully\par
separated wakes are presented .  the afterbodies are generally\par
similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end\par
of the forebody .\par
  tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a\par
range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical\par
flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering\par
models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft.\par
altitude .  stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to\par
  strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows\par
which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or\par
slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a\par
short distance and then connects with the afterbody .  judiciously\par
interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat\par
wider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are\par
presented and compared with each other in terms of\par
nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the\par
forebody .\par
  the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be\par
roughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody,\par
the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody\par
end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or\par
reynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds\par
number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained\par
from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and\par
some quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number\par
range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit\par
boundary layers were considered to be laminar .  an approximate\par
check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present\par
tests also indicates a laminar rate .  no information was obtained\par
concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated\par
boundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient\par
on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was\par
observed .\par
  heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an\par
afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise\par
direction is noted .  the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies\par
with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end)\par
roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) .\par
  heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost\par
twice the values on the sides .  the heat rates on the large-step\par
body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .\par
  in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion\par
angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing\par
test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach\par
number square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the\par
effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually\par
constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody\par
heat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the\par
afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the\par
stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on\par
this body .\par

general equations of thin shells of revolution subjected to\par
rotationally symmetric pressure and temperature\par
distributions .\par
  the basic differential equations are in a very general\par
form, which permits the geometry of the shells considered,\par

  the analysis determines elastic stresses, strains and\par
displacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells of\par
revolution .  surface loads, temperatures, thicknesses and\par
material properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridional\par
direction .  temperatures and material properties can also\par
vary through the thickness .\par

investigator v. g. galerkin, whose original papers are\par
inaccessible to the present writer .  his knowledge\par
of the method is derived from a description given in\par
a paper by e. p. grossman .  grossman states\par
that the method was given by galerkin in his treatise\par
p. 897), and that applications to oscillation problems\par
were first made by v. p. lyskov .  it is pointed\par
out by grossman that galerkin's process in applications\par
to mechanics leads to the same results as\par
lagrange's principle of virtual work, but employs a\par
special co-ordinate system .\par
  the method of galerkin belongs to the same general\par
class as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeks\par
to obtain an approximate solution of a differential\par
equation with given boundary conditions by taking\par
a function which satisfies these conditions exactly,\par
and proceeds to specialise the function in such a\par
manner as to secure approximate satisfaction of the\par
differential equation .  the selected function is\par
a linear combination of n independent functions, and\par
the coefficients are determined by a process of\par
integration .\par
  the galerkin process can be considered from two\par
points of view, (a) simply as a means for the\par
approximate solution of differential equations, and\par
treatment of problems concerning the statics and\par
dynamics of elastic and other deformable bodies .\par
these two aspects are treated separately in parts 1\par
and 2 of the paper respectively, and will now\par
be briefly discussed .\par
which satisfies the boundary conditions, in\par
the differential equation be .  since the result should be\par
zero, is the error in the differential equation .\par
then the galerkin process consists in choosing the n\par
coefficients in the function in such a manner that\par
n distinct weighted means of the error, taken throughout\par
a certain range of representation, shall all\par
be zero .\par
as a generalised force, and the multipliers used\par
to weight the errors are the virtual displacements\par
corresponding to increments of each of the generalised\par
co-ordinates in turn .  thus the vanishing of the\par
weighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishing\par
of the virtual work in the appropriate displacement .\par
  the degree of accuracy attaindd can be increased\par
indefinitely by increasing the number of\par
independent functions employed, but this entails a great\par
increase of labour .  however, when the functions\par
are well chosen, an excellent approximation can be\par
obtained by the use of a very small number, as is\par
sufficiently shown by the examples included in this paper .\par

  this paper is concerned with the nonlinear\par
axisymmetric analysis of circular plates with in-plane\par

loads are accommodated as an extension of\par
investigations performed for the isothermal mechanical\par
loading problem .  an exact mathematical\par
formulation within the framework of the v. karman large\par
strain-displacement relations is developed .  the\par
equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are then\par
derived by utilizing the calculus of variations for\par
arbitrary axisymmetrical temperatures and normal\par
distributed loading .  the satisfaction of equilibrium and\par
compatibility equations requires the solution of two\par
simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations\par
subject to the prescribed boundary conditions .\par

the nonlinear conical spring .\par
  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are\par
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most\par
applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner\par
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several\par
approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of\par
these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the\par
assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the\par
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the\par
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .\par
another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the\par
shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of\par
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter\par
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .\par
recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special\par
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .\par
numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these\par
conditions of load have also been obtained (4) .  an examination\par
of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are\par
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending\par
stresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the\par
meridional bending moment .\par

ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .\par
  the analytic investigation of laminar combustion\par
processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional\par
present some mathematical difficulties .  there are,\par
however, several examples of two-dimensional flame\par
propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in\par
comparison with that in the principal direction of flow .\par
such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching\par
by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate,\par
combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases\par
the problem may be simplified by employing what is\par
known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer\par
approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his\par
treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it\par
consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is\par
small, the variations of flow properties along the direction\par
of main flow are small in comparison with those in a\par
direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic\par
description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present\par
analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the\par
laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas\par
streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible\par
mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two\par
streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar\par
mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is\par
modified by viscosity, and the temperature and\par
composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical\par
reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream\par
is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with\par
temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law .\par
for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature\par
distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does\par
the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far\par
downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear\par
and what is the detailed process of development .  since\par
the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition\par
always takes place at some point of the stream .  however,\par
when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a\par
certain value, the distance required for ignition increases\par
so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a\par
physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete\par
development of the laminar flame front is computed using\par
an approximation similar to the integral technique\par
introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .\par

the values of c for a blunt-nosed tube are found to be less than those\par
for tubes with hemispheroidal heads, but always greater than unity in\par
the range considered . the effect of the orifice size is to decrease c\par
as the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases\par
 with the reynolds number . at a reynolds number of ten the decrease is\par
at most five per cent of the value of c when there is no orifice .\par

  this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usually\par

configurations .\par
  because of the high turning losses incurred by deflected-slipstream\par
configurations in hovering and because of the wing-stalling problem of\par
the pure tilt-wing configurations during the transition, it appears that\par
a combination of the two principles should be used .  this tilt-wing and\par
flap configuration should make use of a programed extensible-chord\par
slotted flap together with a leading-edge high-lift device in order to\par
avoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated with\par
wing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as low\par
as possible for efficiency in cruising flight .\par

aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 .\par
results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamic\par
heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . data\par
obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced\par
cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the\par
hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range . tests made at a\par
mach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments\par
 of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature\par
can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders\par
with only a slight increase in the stagnation rate . the total heat\par
transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than\par
the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders .\par
comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions\par
showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by\par
available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/\par
reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves\par
 open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where\par
they usually differ .\par
tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2.49 and at angles\par
of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnation\par
point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at\par
creased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreased\par
about 20 percent at 15degree angle of attack .\par
preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibility\par
that this type of design may be developed to give heating rates\par
significantly lower than even the flat-faced cylinder rates . the test results\par
 have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenon\par
which can increase the heating rates to extremely high values .\par

a study of second-order supersonic flow theory .\par
  an attempt is made to develop a second approximation to the\par
solution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved by\par
existing first-order theory .  the method of attack adopted is an\par
iteration process using the linearized solution as the first step .\par
  for plane flow it is found that a particular integral of the\par
iteration equation can be written down at once in terms of the\par
first-order solution .  the second-order problem is thereby\par
reduced to an equivalent first-order problem and can be readily\par
solved .  at the surface of an isolated body, the solution reduces\par
to the well-known result of busemann .  the plane case is\par
considered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the\par
nature of the iteration process .\par
  again, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced to a\par
first-order problem by the discovery of a particular integral .\par
for smooth bodies, the second-order solution can then be\par
calculated by the method of von karman and moore .  bodies\par
with corners are also treated by a slight modification of the\par
method .  the second-order solution for cones represents a\par
considerable improvement over the linearized result .\par
second-order theory also agrees well with several solutions for other\par
bodies of revolution calculated by the numerical method of\par
characteristics .\par
  for full three-dimensional flow, only a partial particular\par
integral has been found .  as an example of a more general\par

plastic stability theory of thin shells .\par
  considerable interest is currently centered on the\par
role of deformation and flow types of plasticity\par
theories in the solution of stability problems .  for\par
thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with\par
classical stability theory appears to yield results which\par
are in substantially good agreement with test data .\par
on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear\par
to require the introduction of initial imperfections in\par
order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with\par
tests .\par
  thus, in view of the current state of development of\par
plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit\par
the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation\par
theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of\par
thin shells .  although there may be theoretical\par
objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on\par
flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results\par
obtained from this theory .\par
  in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential\par
equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant\par
unequal radii is derived .  this set of three equations\par
applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any\par
loading system leading to buckling .  for particular\par
problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial\par
compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres\par
under external pressure, the set of equations can be\par
reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential\par
equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial\par
displacement only .  these donnell-type equations are\par
used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres\par
under external pressure and long and moderate length\par
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  the\par
limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under\par

on the role of initial imperfections in plastic buckling\par
of cylinders under axial compression .\par
in a recent paper lee treated the complex problem of the\par
plastic buckling and postbuckling behavior of an axially\par
compressed cylindrical shell containing initial imperfections,\par
representing an important step forward in our understanding of this\par
common, yet perplexing, structural element .  lee drew two\par
major conclusions ..  (a) even with initial imperfections the\par
incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the\par
buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory,\par
which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and\par
strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are\par
significant .\par
  it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion\par
in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other\par
experimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6\par
aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic\par
buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential\par
modes .  in particular, this writer does not believe that lee has\par
proved that initial imperfections are important for the group\par
of cylinders that he has tested .  on the contrary, it is believed\par
that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this\par
group of cylinders although of probable significance in other\par
cases .\par

the buckling of sandwich type panels .\par
  fifty-one flat rectangular sandwich-type panels were tested\par
in edgewise compression with the unloaded edges of the panels\par
restrained by v-grooves .  the sandwich consisted of papreg\par
faces and a cellular cellulose acetate core .  the thickness of the\par
faces varied from 0.00675 to 0.02025 in.,. the core, from 0.066\par
to 0.741 in.,. the width of the panel, from 4 to 11 in .  the length\par
of the panel was always 10.5 in .  the buckled shape consisted of\par
a ripple of short wave length across the panel .  it was either\par
symmetric, the two faces bulging out symmetrically according\par
to sine curves, or skew, the two faces deflecting in the same sense\par
according to sine curves having a phase angle of 90 .\par
  a strain energy theory of buckling is presented for both the\par
symmetric and the skew cases, and the buckling load in the\par
symmetric case is also calculated by integration of the differential\par
equation .  the agreement between the theoretic and the\par
experimental buckling stress is reasonable, that between the predicted\par
and actual buckled shape good .  a simple formula is developed\par

torispherical shells - a caution to designers .\par
  it has recently become apparent, through\par
a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case\par
that designing torispherical shells by the\par
current edition of the asme code on unfired\par
pressure vessels can lead to failure during\par
proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose\par
of the present paper is to show in what\par
respects the code fails to give accurate results .\par
as an illustrative example, a hypothetical\par
pressure vessel with a torispherical head\par
having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was\par
selected .  the supports of the vessel were\par
considered to be either on the main cylinder\par
or around the torus .  the vessel was\par
subjected to internal pressure and the elastic\par
stresses in it were determined rigorously and\par
by the code .  a comparison of the two\par
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the\par
head which were less than one half of those\par
actually occurring .  furthermore, the code\par
gave no indication of the presence of high\par
compressive circumferential direct stresses\par
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically\par
the entire torus .  if the head had been\par
fabricated using a steel with a yield point of\par
would have failed or undergone large\par
deformations, whereas the code would have\par
predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules\par
for torispherical heads are thus in need of\par
revision for certain geometries .  the\par
implications of the foregoing results are currently\par
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,\par
however, designers should exercise care in\par
applying the code to torispherical shells .\par
  it is also shown in the paper that the use\par
of the membrane state as a particular\par
solution of the differential equations is not a\par
good approximation for toroidal shells of the\par
type considered .\par

  the author obtains asymptotic solutions to the problem\par

elastic shells .  he first reduces the problem to that of\par
integrating a single linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential\par
equation involving two parameters .  asymptotic formulae\par
for the complementary function are obtained by applying\par
the general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33,\par
advantage of yielding results valid near the points where\par
the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution,\par
where the methods of asymptotic integration customary in\par
shell theory fail (see the preceding review) .  for two\par
problems in which only the complementary function is required,\par
the author's results are compared with those obtained by\par
wissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) by a method of power\par
series expansion,. the agreement is within 4 or better .  the\par
author observes that the usual method of obtaining\par
asymptotic expressions for a particular integral, being based on\par
using as an approximation the complementary function\par
obtained from the membrane theory, will fail near points\par
where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of\par
revolution .  he therefore introduces a new method, which\par
he states was developed jointly with e. reissner .  he applies\par
his results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetrically\par
and parallel to its axis, a corrugated pipe subject to axial\par
load, and a corrugated cylinder subject to axial pressure .\par

slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft models\par
operating near the ground .\par
a collection of data from a number of brief investigations made with\par
three different models to determine the character of the slipstream flow\par
along the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtol\par
aircraft configurations operating near the ground .  in general, the tests\par
involved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for\par
several tilt-wing vtol models .  a more extensive series of tests,\par
including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream\par
and some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching\par
moments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering\par
condition near the ground .\par
the results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a stronger\par
and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to\par
some extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one\par
wing), than to the side of the aircraft .  this effect is caused by an\par
intensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes\par
of flow symmetry .  the intensified flow along the center line of the\par
aircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the\par
dynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be\par
expected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers .\par
in the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small,\par
was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be\par
thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on\par
the ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of the\par
gravel) .  results of the investigation of moment fluctuations\par
indicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing,\par
and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erratic\par
inflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source of\par
these moments .\par

heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper\par
atmosphere .\par
a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic\par
theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for\par
steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution\par
was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily\par
extended to bodies of arbitrary shape .\par
it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of\par
solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of\par
negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to\par
steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar\par
radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly\par
important as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150\par
miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that\par
determines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar\par
radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of\par
nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures .\par
in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the\par
angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should\par
be kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice\par
by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at\par
small angles of attack .\par
it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring\par
thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive\par
and negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface\par
as possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically,\par
this may be accomplished by boattailing the body .\par
in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is\par
shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of\par
magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally\par
by emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural\par
radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures .\par
it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide\par
range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity\par
of the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is\par
based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent\par
of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy .\par
a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by\par
the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in\par
thermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be\par
used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation\par
coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .\par

on the influence of wall boundary layers in closed transonic test\par
sections .\par
the boundary layers at the test section walls of a transonic wind tunnel\par
 are known to reduce the wall interference . in the present paper this\par
effect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assuming\par
viscosity to be negligible when perturbing a turbulent boundary layer . an\par
approximation for thin boundary layers leads to a modified boundary\par
condition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normal\par
streamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflow\par
within the boundary layer . this boundary condition is applied to the\par
linearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonic\par
equations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only\par
 being treated in detail .\par
the results of linear theory show that all corrections except the\par
three-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by\par
 the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9,\par
the essential part of their influence being due to the change of mass\par
flow density with pressure . in the case of choking the analysis\par
indicates that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximum\par
model size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding to\par
mach number one in free flight . finally, the technique of using\par
artificial thickening of the wall boundary layers for a reduction of wall\par
interference is considered, though without reaching a definite\par
conclusion as to its value as compared to other techniques .\par

pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means of\par

walls has been varied . within the investigated range it appeared that a\par
 thickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence of\par
the walls, which also caused an increase of the choking mach number .\par

rotation, is not a function of disk\par
loading but merely a function of\par
the gross weight or thrust of the\par

different in the plane of\par

considered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform\par

stresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressure\par
vessels .\par
  a short discussion is given of the possible methods for\par
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local\par
loadings .  it is concluded that the method of developing\par
the loads and displacements into double fourier series\par
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical\par
evaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressions\par
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by\par
reducing the three partial differential equations of the\par
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the\par
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical\par
with, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of the\par
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external\par
loading in this equation leads directly to a double series\par
expression of the radial displacement w in terms of the load\par
factors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent\par
expressions for the other displacements and for the\par
bending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial\par
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to\par
it are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,\par
tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the\par
circumferential direction, (d) a moment in the\par
circumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short\par
distance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these\par
loadings the load factors, which have to be used in the\par
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending\par
moments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case\par
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential\par
equation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the\par
tangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the\par
displacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for\par
tangential loading within a rectangle are found .\par

then is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins with\par

method may be considered a major modification of one developed earlier\par

a study of slender shapes of minimum drag using the\par
newton-busemann pressure coefficient law .\par
  the problem of minimizing the drag of a slender, two-\par
dimensional or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angle of\par
attack is considered under the assumption that the pressure\par
coefficient law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in\par
order to include centripetal acceleration effects .  after the\par
condition that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted\par
for and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition\par
to the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment\par
of inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the\par
wetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the\par
minimal problem is formulated as a problem of the mayer type and\par
solved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations,\par
the transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner\par
condition, and the properties of the switching function .\par
  particular attention is devoted to the class of problems such\par
that, among the four quantities being considered, two are\par
prescribed while the remaining are free .  for these problems, the\par
extremal arc is composed of two subarcs ..  one is characterized by\par
a positive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the\par
other is characterized by a zero pressure coefficient and is called\par
the free layer .  in this connection, the analysis shows the\par
existence of two different types of solutions depending on whether the\par
thickness is given or free .\par
  if the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape is\par
a power law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free\par
layer occurs in the second half of the body .  in the two-\par
dimensional case, the exponent of the power law is 1 if the length is given\par
if the enclosed area is given, and 3 if the moment of inertia\par
of the contour is given,. the transition point from the power\par
body to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the\par
length is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at\par
the axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if\par
the length is given, 1 if the wetted area is given, and if the\par
volume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the\par
free layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is\par
given, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent\par
if the volume is given .\par
  on the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free,\par
the equation governing the regular shape is not that of a power\par
body, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the\par
first half of the body .  in the two-dimensional case, the\par
transition point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the\par
enclosed area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment\par
of inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the\par
enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given .\par
in the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35\par
percent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given,\par
at 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46\par
percent if the wetted area and the volume are given .\par
  for all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are\par
obtained for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag\par
coefficients .\par

potentials occur across the planar shock and square-root\par
singularities in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks\par
with the cruciform surfaces .  the problem is simple enough so\par
that these interesting features stand out clearly .\par
  a second-order solution uniformly valid to first order is\par
constructed by adjustment of the ordinary second-order solution\par
obtained first .  the uniformly valid solution has two different\par
series representations in the thickness parameter .  one is the\par
ordinary second-order series in ascending integral powers of the\par
thickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the\par
vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone, and the other is a series\par
containing fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream\par
of this mach cone .  the uniformly valid solution gives the\par
detailed wave structure and shows a flow regime upstream of the\par
vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the\par
ordinary theory .  the two solutions are otherwise identical .\par
the wave structure consists of a pyramidal arrangement of planar\par
shocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by\par
weaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely\par
weak shocks coincident with the vertex-centered undisturbed\par
mach cone .  as an example of the above, detailed results are\par

reynolds number at which transition occurred when the surface\par

reversal does not occur on a polished spherical surface within the\par

supersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition .\par
  an analytical method is presented which permits a very rapid\par
evaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the addition\par
of small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensional\par
airfoils .  this method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heat\par
conduction .  also, the mechanism by which the sesired heat\par
addition is achieved is not considered .\par
  it is shown that even small amounts of heat generate a\par
substantial pressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in the\par
acrodynamic coefficients .  the results of this analysis compare\par
favorably with those obtained by a more accurate, but also more\par

  theoretical and experimental data relating to the downwash\par
impingement problem are examined in order to arrive at a\par
coherent understanding of the process of entrainment of ground\par
particles in the flow .  it is demonstrated that a key mechanism\par
in the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground\par
boundary layer with bluff ground particles .  this interaction\par
produces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals or\par
exceeds the particle weight .\par
  in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions\par
necessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas\par
in the impinging jet are examined .  these are the viscous decay,\par
the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces\par
on a bluff body in nonuniform flow .  applicable theories are\par
used in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy\par
and range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream\par
conditions which will cause particle entrainment .\par
  available data are applied to the establishment of criteria for\par
particle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet\par
stagnation point .  these criteria show that entrainment occurs in a\par
finite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles\par
most readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to about\par
two-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer .  the\par
configuration size is shown to influence the process in that the\par
onset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity,\par
and the size of the ground particles .  the criteria established\par
provide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causing\par

disturbance or wave created by the vibrating ribbon .  as the wave\par
travels downstream, it is deformed into a three-dimensional\par
configuration by the three-dimensionality of the boundary-layer\par
flow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small in\par
intensity .  it is only after the wave intensity exceeds a certain\par

layers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface models\par

values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with\par
values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional\par

heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablation\par
of vapor of arbitrary molecular weight .\par
  the reduction of heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer\par
under the condition of vaporizing ablation is analyzed for\par
arbitrary molecular weight of the vapor .  primary assumptions are\par
that the pressure gradient is zero, the individual components of\par
the binary system are perfect gases, the prandtl number is\par
constant, and the viscosity is proportional to temperature .\par
variations through the boundary layer of the schmidt number for\par
binary diffusion and the density-viscosity product, are\par
included in the analysis .  the wall temperature is held constant .\par
numerical results are obtained for prandtl numbers of 0.75 and\par
varying from 0.25 to 4.00, wall concentration of the foreign gas\par
as high as 0.9 (corresponding to the high heat rates encountered\par
during re-entry), and ratio of specific heats of foreign gas equal\par
to that of air .  kinetic theory is used to obtain schmidt number\par
as a function of molecular weight and concentration .\par
  the departure of schmidt number and prandtl number from\par
unity and the variation of reynolds analogy factor with prandtl\par
number, blowing parameter, wall concentration, and molecular\par
weight ratio are found to have relatively minor influence on the\par
heat block ratio at high rates of ablation .  the primary factor\par
governing the influence of molecular weight ratio on the heat\par
block ratio is the variation of across the boundary layer .\par
little loss of accuracy is incurred, in the range of molecular weight\par
ratios considered here, by assuming schmidt and prandtl\par
numbers of unity as long as the variation is properly taken into account .\par

the effect of sweep angle on hypersonic flow over blunt\par

  a series of tests were carried out in the princeton university\par
helium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two-dimensional wings\par
at zero angle of attack with sweep angles up to 70 at mach\par
numbers from 7 to 15 .  the leading edge reynolds number varied\par
from 3,000 to 25,000 .  the measured pressure distributions were\par
compared with the simple summation of the theoretical inviscid\par
effect (based on blast wave theory using the normal mach\par
number) added to the viscous effect (calculated as if no sweep\par
were present) .  for the unswept wing, the slope of the pressure\par
decay was reasonably well predicted by the theoretical\par
calculations .  the viscous theory reasonably predicted the variation in\par
the pressure distribution due to changes in leading-edge\par
reynolds number .  by subtracting the theoretical viscous effects, an\par
inviscid mach number dependence of the 2.2 power was found\par
as compared to the value of 2.0 predicted by the inviscid theory .\par
the same approach for the swept wing did not give consistently\par
satisfactory results .  deviations avove and below the calculated\par
value by as much as 40-50 percent were measured and there\par
seemed to be no systematic variation with either mach number or\par
reynolds number .  at a constant high reynolds number, it was\par
found that the pressure distribution varied with the distance\par
along the wing with an exponent between about--0.53 and--0.58\par
except for a rather sharp decrease which occurred for the 70\par
sweep case .  the pressure at a given station for a fixed mach\par
number and given leading edge thickness varied as the cosine of\par
the sweep angle to the 1.1 power as compared to the 1.3 power\par
predicted from general geometrical considerations .\par

a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer\par
over a curved surface .\par
  the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for\par
surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer\par
flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .\par
  the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated\par
by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the\par
generalized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is\par
applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation\par
in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer\par
equations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the\par
boundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple\par
transformation, the governing differential equation can be\par
expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation\par
for zero surface curvature .\par
  numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a\par
flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient\par
have been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer\par
and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex\par
surfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall\par
is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on\par
the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop\par
below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to\par
reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase\par
again .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a\par
different method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results\par
with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic\par
differences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular,\par
murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex\par
surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall\par
it is higher .\par

  an investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations\par
composed of a cambered body positioned a certain distance\par
beneath an arbitrary lifting wing .  the geometry of the wing is\par
regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or\par
optimum .  expressions for the drag and lift are obtained from\par
reverse-flow considerations,. these greatly implement such a\par
study when interference cross flows must be cancelled .  the\par
drag advantage to be gained when a given body and wing\par
assume a given orientation is studied .  treated more extensively\par
is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing\par
incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and\par
length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed lift .\par
numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large\par
number of parameters appearing in the problem .  of these, the\par
gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly\par
important .  it is found that at low gap moderate body\par
distortions have a significant influence on the drag .  drag reductions\par
of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been\par
found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a\par
gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,\par
and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body .\par
comparison is made with the conventional wing-body\par
combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that\par
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not\par
appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the\par
configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower\par
than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations .\par
  tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a\par
scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile\par
wing .  the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number\par
was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length .  it was found that the\par
measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the\par
body agrees very well with the theoretical value .  downstream\par
of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was\par
observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the\par
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock\par
but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the\par
body of the shock-induced cross flow .  further observations\par
suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body\par
or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the\par
shock-induced cross flow .\par

lines .  the viscous domain is divided into n curvilinear strips .\par
the governing equations are then integrated along the\par

some considerations on the laminar stability of time-dependent basic\par
flows .\par
as a stability criterion for infinitesimal disturbances in an\par
incompressible, parallel but time-dependent basic flow, it is proposed\par
to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said\par
to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,\par
as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to\par
decrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed .\par
for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar\par
velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),\par
in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed to\par
reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  the\par
disturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or the\par
longitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizing\par
influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the\par
velocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of fales\par
rotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the deceleration .\par
at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the\par
stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further\par
shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration .\par
even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral\par
stability may not be used without reservation .  to calculate\par
momentary stability properly, a procedure for a slowly varying but more\par
general profile is also described .\par

on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet .\par
  a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum\par
noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent\par
jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the /\par
quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound-\par
emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher\par
than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an\par
irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were\par
frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar\par
shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it .\par
  the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent\par
the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer .\par
acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as\par
transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/\par
or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is\par
visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of\par
geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in\par
transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic\par
waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in\par
ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at\par
speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium .\par
however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise\par
of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the\par
fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to\par
lighthill .\par
  those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect\par
to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer\par
are significantly modified by the viscous action through the\par
critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective\par
amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it .\par
kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream\par
emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation\par
significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power\par
output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions\par
augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as,\par
predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective\par
corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per\par
unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted\par
downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating\par
the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may\par
increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing\par
action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be\par
interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of\par
the shear-layer profiles .\par

solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problems\par

  the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximate\par
solution of the integral equation which represents the potential\par
flow about a finite wing, with no restrictions beyond those\par
necessary for linearization .  after assuming the usual series\par
representation of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solution\par
is achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of the\par
transformed integral equation by single and double fourier series and\par
performing termwise integrations analytically .  this is followed\par
by the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient\par
matrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at\par
selected control points .  in this procedure the number of control\par
point used is limited only by the storage capacity of the\par
computer .  control points may be located so as to cover the entire\par
wing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements,\par
permitting the accurate representation of complicated mean\par
surface shapes .\par
  an evaluation of the proposed method is included .\par
comparisons with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tank\par
results are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed\par
method when applied to plane wings .  a final evaluation\par
involves a comparison of calculated surface pressure distribution\par
with wind-tunnel measurements on a swept, tapered wing with\par
a cambered and twisted mean surface .  the agreement evidenced\par
in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy as\par
similar comparisons on plane wing planforms .  in either case,\par
the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracy\par
requirements for most aircraft design studies .\par

constraining conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock and\par

and the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridian\par

  as a general result of the investigation, it can be said that the\par
boom of a projectile for given mach number and flight altitude\par
is primarily determined by its length and fineness ratio .  the\par
maximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodies\par

an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method .\par
  the problem is considered of calculating approximately the\par
inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a\par
smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing\par
edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the\par
assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for\par
the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic\par
shock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary\par
characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple\par
shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing\par
the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances\par
it may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic\par
variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then\par
formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock\par
shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the\par
special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is,\par
for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape\par
expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result\par
previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender\par
bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by\par
friedrichs .\par
  employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion\par
method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent\par
perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent\par
flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers\par
of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an\par
oblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those\par
regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to\par
taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected\par
in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and\par
reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary\par
conditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for\par
the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure\par
distribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals\par
involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the\par
method of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its\par
accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure\par
distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at\par
an infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are\par
compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available,\par
and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .\par

and modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskii\par
and bolshakov .  the analysis is applied to the case of constant\par
pressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, for\par
which the crocco velocity-enthalpy relation holds .  although\par
simplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outside\par
the 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends are\par
probably correct outside this range .  the limiting cases near 0\par
and 180 are not considered .\par
  favorable agreement between some results obtained by the\par
integral method and by other methods is demonstrated for the\par
isothermal, constant-density case .\par
  results show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermost\par
isovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increases .\par

corner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaces .  within\par
the interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction of\par
the disturbed region of merging is influenced by surface\par
heat-transfer conditions .  surface shear and heat flux are decreased\par
in the disturbed region, and are zero at the apex .  for cases\par
corresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of wider\par
corner angles, the /specific momentum-area/ exhibits the same\par

perpendicular to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbed\par
direction of the stream .  it is assumed that the kinematic\par
viscosity is small .  the first approximation is taken to be the\par
undisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtained\par
by iferation .  the second approximation is the blasius shear\par
layer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate .\par
in turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to the\par
plate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocities\par
are 0, to match with the conditions at infinity .  further,\par
the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must be\par
completed to 0 by introducing a secondary shear layer .  the\par
regions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,.\par
in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs special\par
care, because the determination of the chief terms is complicated\par
by the presence of powers of log .  in particular it is shown\par

equilibrium degree of dissociation behind the shock front, and hence the\par
density, for the case where the vibrational degrees of freedom are\par
frozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence the\par
density, for the case where all degrees of freedom are in\par
equilibrium .  thus the necessary condition for a maximum of the\par
density between the shock front and the position of full\par
equilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  the\par
sufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shown\par
to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees\par
of freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag\par
the approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,.\par
that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in\par
the respective relaxation times before such a maximum might be\par
observed .  an example calculation for a mach 13 strong shock\par

permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than\par
the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general\par
character of the boundary layer .  the method offers the\par
simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts\par
rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled\par
differential equations required by existing methods .  the method also\par
affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total\par
boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as\par
well as the nondimensional velocity distribution .\par
the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two\par
regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall\par
and an outer region which is described by a function depicting\par
the deviation from that law .  the deviation function involves\par
two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the\par
skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical\par
purposes, can be considered a constant .  since the entire\par
velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent\par
upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the\par
generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region\par
of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream\par
conditions .\par

those calculated by the method presented here is generally very\par

the linearized problem of a jet-flap system is found to be the\par
linear combination of a lift problem and a thrust problem .  the\par
lift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to note\par
that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed by\par
the jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theory .\par
  the mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzed\par
by the momentum-integral method .  the analysis substantiates\par

causing the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of high\par

stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heated\par
boundary layer .\par
  it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes in\par
heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two\par
conceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat\par
transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain\par
distance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocity\par
and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance\par
determines the position of the propagating flame .  in the second\par
mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a\par
continuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot\par
recirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous\par
ignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is the\par
characteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines\par
the position of the flame .\par
  all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with\par
conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable .\par
in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show\par
under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides\par
the appropriate model and also how the two models are related .\par
to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to\par
study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over a\par
wall heated in the form of a step function .  with a turbulent\par
boundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., the\par
characteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproducible\par
variable .  these observations led to the conclusion that a\par
continuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated\par
turbulent boundary layers .  a rational explanation is made for the\par
transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable\par
in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar\par
boundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated\par
turbulent boundary layers .\par
  as a further verification of the continuous ignition mechanism\par
an apparent ignition energy was found .  the logarithm of the heat\par
added at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear function\par
of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature .  the activation\par
energy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreed\par
reasonably well with the estimated value for the fuel used .\par

theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamics .\par
  a supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite\par
cylinder as a hub is studied .  the forward speed may be subsonic, but\par
the relative speed at each section is supersonic .  the lightly\par
loaded blades are represented by a surface distribution of\par
appropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary\par
supersonic thin-wing theory .  these sources are found by\par
approximating the exact potential for a constant-strength\par
compressible source traveling along a helical path .  the usual\par
relationship between the source strength and boundary condition is\par
found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the\par
appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry .\par
  tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard\par
and krasilshchikova .  the present investigation, however, is\par
restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears\par
off the tip .  for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained\par
through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the\par
upwash region off the tip .  by transforming to a curvilinear,\par
nonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach\par
lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral\par
equation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is\par
derived .  without having to solve this equation, it is shown that\par
the potential for a point in the tip region can be obtained in terms\par
of an integration of known source distributions over the blade\par
surface only .\par
  the case of a twisted flat plate of particular planform is treated,\par
and a sample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at\par
selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion\par
of the blade, as well as over the entire tip region .\par
  though this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic\par
propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary\par
derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles .\par

a study of vortex cancellation .\par
  the cancellation of a vortex by means of another concentric\par
vortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated .  when\par
such a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure .\par
the vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional\par
airfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the\par
wake of the other .  the airfoils have opposite effective angles of\par
attack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as\par
required .\par
  it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum\par
angle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex\par
from the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of\par
the two airfoils .  a theoretical solution of this optimum angle of\par
attack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of\par
attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of\par
the wings .  the pressure recovery accompanying the vortex\par
cancellation is also studied .  theoretical considerations, based on\par
the model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube\par
show that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop\par
across the first airfoil can be recovered .  this maximum is\par
imposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the\par
irreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field .\par
experimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized .\par
  perhaps the primary value of the present study is the\par
opportunity it provides to verify certain of the fundamental concepts\par
of fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailing\par
vortex system of a lifting wing is cancelled by a second wing .\par

type, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flow .  the other type\par

sublimation in a hypersonic environment .\par
  a priori knowledge of the response of materials subjected to a\par
severe aerothermal environment is essential in the space age .\par
the successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demands\par
that the fundamental problem of the interaction between a\par
material and dissociated air be properly formulated and solved .  in\par
this paper, the problem of sublimation in a hypersonic\par
environment is considered .\par
  in this study of hypersonic ablation, the pertinent\par
conservation equations are derived and the simultaneous processes of\par
diffusion, convection, and thermal exchange are analyzed for the\par
vaporization of a refractory material which is subjected to the\par
environmental conditions encountered during hypersonic\par
reentry .\par
  for simplicity, only the forward stagnation point of an axially\par
symmetric body is treated .  it is shown that the quantity,\par
called the effective heat of vaporization, which includes all heat\par
absorbing or heat blocking effects, is an increasing function of\par
flight speed, independent of body size, except where\par
nonequilibrium vaporization effects or radiative effects appear .\par

wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flow .\par
  it has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produce\par
minimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing\par
surface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced by\par
this distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is\par
constant over the wing surface .  this combined downwash can be\par
expressed by an integral which contains the load as a function\par
of the spanwise and chordwise coordinate .  the problem of\par
finding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the\par
problem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integral\par
equation .\par
  the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is\par
handled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an\par
approximate integration over interpolation polynomials .  the\par
chordwise load distribution is represented by a limited series\par
development in legendre polynomials .  the sigularity of the\par
kernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point\par
can be avoided by a similar legendre development of the\par
combined induced downwash which is constant .  the integral\par
equation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for the\par
unknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load\par
distribution at a limited number of spanwise stations .\par
  practical calculations are carried out on an electronic\par
computer .  the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the\par

distribution .  for many wing plan forms, considerable gains\par
over a plane wing appear possible .\par

boundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressure\par

numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculation\par
of unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidal\par
gusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds .\par
  a numerical lifting-surface method has\par
been used to calculate direct gust\par
forces and moments on wings of several\par
planforms .  the gust velocities are\par
continuous and vary sinusoidally in the stream\par
direction and are also uniform across\par
the wing span .  the procedure has the\par
advantage of rapid machine calculation and\par
includes the effects of wing planform,\par
nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced flow\par
effects .  the method provides for calculation\par
of gust forces on a basis\par
consistent with that for the calculation of forces\par
due to motion and deformation .  the\par
results include the in-phase and quadrature\par
components of the following\par
quantities ..  (a) spanwise distribution of\par
section lift coefficient, (b) total\par
lift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-moment\par
coefficient .  in addition,\par
generalized gust forces on approximate fundamental\par
cantilever bending modes (\par
parabolic) are also included .  results have been\par
obtained for 60 and 75 delta wings,\par
ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspect\par
ratio 6.00 .  conditions for which\par
calculations were made include two mach numbers\par
reduced-frequency range of 0 to 1.0 .  the\par
direct gust forces and moments are in\par
forms suitable to be inserted in equations\par

  an analysis has been made of\par
atmosphere entries for which the\par
spacecraft lift-drag ratios were\par
modulated to limit the maximum\par
deceleration .  the parts of the drag polars\par
used during modulation were from\par
maximum lift coefficient to minimum\par

of different shapes were assumed for\par
the spacecraft .  the entries covered\par
wide ranges of initial velocity,\par
initial flight-path angle, initial\par
and maximum lift-drag ratio .\par
two-dimensional trajectory calculations were\par
made for a nonrotating, spherical\par
earth with an exponential atmosphere .\par
the results of the analysis indicate\par
for four of the five drag polars that,\par
relative to the maximum deceleration\par
of an unmodulated entry at maximum\par
lift-drag ratio, the greatest reduction\par
in maximum deceleration obtainable\par
by modulation depends upon a single\par
parameter .  this parameter is the ratio\par
of the value of the aerodynamic\par
resultant-force coefficient at minimum\par
drag coefficient to the value at\par
maximum lift coefficient .  thus, the\par
reduction in maximum deceleration\par
is independent of initial velocity,\par
initial flight-path angle, initial\par
maximum lift-drag ratio, and\par
the shape of the drag polar .  for\par
the fifth drag polar, the reduction in\par
maximum deceleration was found to\par
depend upon the maximum lift-drag ratio .\par
also, relative to the depth of a\par
given deceleration-limited corridor, the\par
greatest increase in corridor depth\par
obtainable by modulation (for four of\par

the same ratio of aerodynamic\par

included nose bluntness, flare half-angle,\par

two test nozzles with design\par
mach numbers of 3.74 and 4.60 were operated\par
with compressed air to\par
simulate the initial jet-boundary shape of a\par
particular solid-propellant\par
rocket motor operating between altitudes\par
of 165,000 and 215,000 feet .\par
the ratio of the jet pressure to free-stream\par
static pressure varied from\par
a jet-off condition to approximately 1,300\par
for the nozzle with design mach\par
number of 3.74, and from a jet-off condition\par
to approximately 280 for the\par
nozzle with design mach number of 4.60 .\par
the angle-of-attack range was\par
from 0 to approximately 6 .\par
  the results indicate that as the\par
jet-pressure ratio was increased\par
the size of the jet plume increased,\par
and as a result the model static\par
stability was decreased .  increasing\par
the angle of attack resulted in a\par
reduction in static instability during\par
the jet-on condition .  increasing\par
nose bluntness resulted in a more forward\par

some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition\par
and heat transfer at supersonic speeds .\par
  large downstream movements of transition observed when the\par
leading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly\par
blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds\par
number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the\par
detached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction is\par
computed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 .\par
concurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur\par
in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar\par
boundary layer .\par
  the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is\par
substantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is\par
blunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the\par
downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to\par
the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or\par
leading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading\par
edge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with the\par
hollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 .\par
  application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields\par
the result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leading\par
edge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements of\par
transition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 3.0 to 30 at mach\par
the possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and friction\par
drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds .\par
  mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and\par
wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached\par
shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20 .  the dissipation and\par
stability of these profiles are discussed, and a method is\par
described for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce\par
the maximum possible downstream movement of transition .\par

  in a former paper (1) it has been shown that the\par

be described mathematically by the same equations which are also\par
applied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in the\par

relation is still valid when the compressibility is taken into\par

on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .\par
the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock\par
technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and\par
high-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to\par
disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from\par
 the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for\par
that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak\par
enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach\par
number, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to\par
remain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much\par
longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are\par
predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the\par
expansion wave originating at the diaphragm .\par
outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the\par
 arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first\par
disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately\par
 equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the\par
contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it\par
 appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation\par
are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a\par
heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for\par
further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the\par
multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end\par
 of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach\par
number . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected\par
disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in\par
 theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .\par
experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to\par
provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if\par
allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact\par
surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and\par
transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave\par
reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised\par
substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow\par
duration may result .\par
a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of\par
the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is\par
attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its\par
interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further\par
research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the\par
effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of\par
the tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion\par
wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that\par
the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a\par
severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock\par
mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow\par
duration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to\par
suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to\par
have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over\par
a range of shock mach number .\par
it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock\par
mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach\par
number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using\par
reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because\par
of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and\par
the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present\par
investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .\par
further research is required to check and extend the findings, and\par
topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .\par

the sodium-line reversal method, as previously described, using a\par

are now employed, and interference filters are used in front of the\par
photomultipliers instead of a spectrograph . in one beam the background\par
source is viewed directly, through the shock tube, and in the other beam\par
 the background source is viewed through the shock tube by a mirror\par
system with a neutral filter interposed to reduce its effective\par
brightness temperature . with a suitably chosen temperature for the\par
background, one oscillograph trace indicates absorption and the other\par
indicates emission of the sodium lines . it is thus possible, from the\par
records of a single shock, to determine the temperature history behind\par
the shock wave to about 20degreec . nitrogen and oxygen again show\par
relaxation effects near the front . temperatures in argon tend to come\par
low, owing to radiative disequilibrium,. excitation processes in argon\par

temperatures rather higher than that of the background source . some work has\par

distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for\par

  in part (1), as a first approach to a theoretical investigation\par
of low aspect ratio rectangular plate wings of constant thickness,\par
the two assumptions are made that ..  (a) the spanwise form of\par
the structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwise\par
distortion arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces are\par
approximations of the supersonic linearized theory .  the form of the\par
chordwise distortion is then deduced from the differential\par
equation representing the state of neutral equilibrium for small\par
displacements at the critical divergence speed .\par
  secondly, this problem is investigated using measured\par
structural flexibility coefficients together with theoretical\par
aerodynamic coefficients .\par
  thirdly, the usual series solution based on the rayleigh-ritz\par
approach is discussed, using the same assumptions as in the first\par
method .\par
  all the results of these methods are consistent and indicate that\par
the transonic regime at m = 1 is the most critical for\par
divergence .\par

equation . it is shown how solutions for flexible wall can be obtained\par

outline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stability\par
 theory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundary . theory\par
is given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexible boundary .\par
 behavior of flexible medium itself is also examined .\par
practical requirements are discussed . for example, a conclusion is that\par
 to avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surface\par
 waves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wave\par
 velocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting waves .\par
 moreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves from\par
developing but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves are\par
permissable . author states that a boundary that is both soft and light,\par
one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure of\par
 the flow, may be practical for use at high speeds . this surface should\par
 have a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instability\par
and a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface wave\par
instability . although paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it gives\par

qualitiative solutions of the stability equation for a boundary layer in\par
 contact with various forms of flexible surface .\par
an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation is\par
developed for the condition where the fluid is in contact with an\par
isotropic and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate\par
analytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at\par
least qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral\par
oscillations . in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as\par
nondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free\par
 of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treated\par
as that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid .\par
the results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surface\par
introduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillation\par
schlichting waves . most of these modes have speeds of propagation\par
determined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their\par
presence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flow\par
stability -dash a subject not treated here . the tollmien-schlichting\par
mode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the\par
surface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper\par
limit as well . indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low\par
rigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this mode\par
altogether, only at the expense, however, of the introduction of a mode of\par
flexural waves .\par

provided the ratio of hole diameter to boundary-layer displacement\par
thickness is less than 2, the ratio of hole pitch to\par
diameter is less than 3 and there are at least three rows of holes\par
in the strip .  with less than three rows, the criteria\par
are much more restrictive .  it is possible to extend laminar flow\par
by suction through perforations whose diameters and\par
pitches exceed these values slightly, but only with the risk that\par
excessive suction quantities will produce wedges of\par
turbulent boundary layer originating at the holes .\par
  a uniform distribution of suction through the holes was\par
necessary .  this was successfully obtained by two methods,\par
the use of cells and throttle holes, and with tapered holes .\par
in particular, tests were carried out on some panels\par
supplied by handley page, ltd., in which the cells and tapered\par
holes had been constructed by commercial methods, and\par
the suction distribution proved satisfactory .\par
  the resistance of some of the cellular arrangements was\par
measured .  it was found that when the suction quantities\par
were the minimum required to maintain laminar flow, the\par
additional losses in total head of the sucked air due to\par
the resistance of the throttle holes could be made small compared\par
with the loss in total head of the sucked boundary\par

theory is outlined in 2, and some known results\par
for the case of an aerofoil of infinite span are included in 3 .  it is\par
shown in 4, by the use of operational methods,\par
that the growth of lift function k (s) corresponding to a sudden unit\par

function corresponding to simple harmonic translational motion .\par
from results given by the writer for rectangular\par
wings (1943) and tapered wings (1945) in simple harmonic motion\par
the corresponding values of k (s) are determined .\par
the growth of lift function k (s) for a wing penetrating a uniform\par
vertical gust can then be estimated as shown in 4\par
and 5 .  by the use of approximate formulae for the growth of lift\par

atmospheric entries with vehicle lift-drag ratio modulated\par
to limit deceleration and rate of deceleration vehicles\par

  an analysis has been made of\par
atmosphere entries for which the\par
vehicle lift-drag ratio was modulated\par
to maintain specified maximum\par
decelerations and or maximum deceleration\par
rates .  the part of the\par
vehicle drag polar used during modulation\par
was from maximum lift\par
coefficient to minimum drag coefficient .  the\par
entries were at parabolic velocity\par
and the vehicle maximum lift-drag ratio\par
was 0.5 .  two-dimensional\par
trajectory calculations were made for a\par
nonrotating, spherical earth with an\par
exponential atmosphere .  the results\par
of the analysis indicate that for a\par
given initial flight-path angle,\par
modulation generally resulted in a\par
reduction of the maximum deceleration\par
to 60 percent of the unmodulated value or\par
a reduction of maximum deceleration\par
rate to less than 50 percent of the\par
unmodulated rate .  these results were\par
equivalent, for a maximum\par
deceleration of 10g, to lowering the undershoot\par
boundary 24 miles with a resulting\par
decrease in total convective heating to\par
the stagnation point of 22 percent .\par
however, the maximum convective heating\par
rate was increased 18 percent,. the\par
maximum radiative heating rate and total\par

increased about 10 percent .\par

  by employing aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's\par
atmosphere at either orbital or /escape/ velocity, the range of\par
allowable entry angles for a prescribed peak deceleration is\par
greatly increased, while the total heat energy transferred to the\par
vehicle can be held to about the same value as for a nonlifting\par
vehicle .  only modest lift-drag ratios are required beyond peak g\par
to prevent the deceleration from exceeding the peak value, or to\par
prevent the vehicle from skipping out of the earth's atmosphere .\par
thus, the difficult guidance and control problem is greatly\par
alleviated,. in particular, for return from the moon or other\par

  when a ramp or other compression\par

secondary shock wave .  the ramp flow\par
disturbance may be viewed as an\par

examination of the applicability of newtonian\par
flow theory to cones and wedges\par
in uniform streams suggests that this\par
theory can be expected to give a\par
useful approximation to the surface\par
pressures .\par
  a pressure equation based on this\par
concept predicts a number of\par
interesting things ..  first, pressures\par
can differ from simple newtonian\par
theory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. for\par
example, on flare stabilizers on\par
blunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressures\par
are lower than newtonian and diminish\par
with increasing flight speed in the\par
hypersonic speed range .  the calculated\par
pressures vary over the flare surface\par
as a result of the nonuniformity of\par
its incident stream, and depend on the\par
axial location of the flare .  in\par
the case of a flap mounted on a\par
large-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressure\par
coefficients vary from 1 to 5 through\par
the variable entropy layer .  a\par
pressure coefficient of 5 greater than\par
the maximum possible in newtonian\par
flow can occur because the compression\par
process is more efficient than a\par
single shock wave process .  on areas\par
of the flap that protrude through\par
the main bow wave, the pressure\par
coefficient should revert to the simple\par
newtonian value .\par
  equations are developed for the\par
initial slopes of the normal-force\par
and pitching-moment curves of a flare\par
stabilizer .  in the simplest case\par
these differ from conventional newtonian\par
theory by the ratio of local\par

an experimental investigation of the interaction between shock waves and\par
 boundary layers .\par
an account is given of an investigation into the interaction between the\par
 boundary layer on a flat plate and a shock wave produced either\par
externally, by a wedge in the supersonic mainstream, or from within the\par
boundary layer, by a wedge held in contact with the plate . a wide range\par
 of free-stream mach numbers, boundary-layer reynolds numbers, and shock\par
 strengths has been covered, shock strength being defined as the ratio\par
of the static pressure downstream of the shock to the static pressure\par
upstream of it . variations in these parameters can have large effects\par
on the interaction, and there are also large differences between cases\par
with externally generated shocks and cases where the shock is generated\par
from within the boundary layer . the investigation has thrown light on\par
the physical mechanisms involved . it is found that many of the major\par
features of the interaction arise because the boundary layer separates\par
from the surface ahead of the shock wave . the conditions under which\par
separation occurs and the behaviour of the separated boundary layer thus\par
 have important effects, in terms of which, for example, the differences\par
 between the interactions observed with laminar and with turbulent\par
boundary layers may be explained .\par

approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer .\par
  after analyzing a large class of boundary-layer\par
velocity-profiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) and\par
h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other\par
over the whole range of positive and negative pressure\par
gradients .  here l, m and h are defined by\par
being the\par
velocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at the\par
edge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement\par
and momentum thickness, respectively .  based on this\par
discovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing\par
two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable\par
boundary-layer flows found in practice .  once these are\par
chosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the\par
form, v being the kinematic\par

  an approximate method for the calculation of the\par

of stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, which\par

these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless\par

of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed .\par

and continuity by\par
where are the coordinate directions, the\par
corresponding velocity components and the uniform free stream\par
velocity which is parallel to the plate .  defining a\par
perturbation stream function by\par
the differential\par
equation to be solved is with boundary\par
conditions far from the plate and\par
when y=0 and .  the authors discuss the\par
problem by applying the two-dimensional fourier\par
transform and obtain an explicit solution for the velocity gradient\par
at the plate which is in disagreement\par
with the result of the blasius solution .  from this\par
the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to\par
use a velocity other than in the linearization of the\par
equations of motion and suggest replacing by where .\par
this choice does not affect the solution far from\par
the plate but gives on the plate and in\par
comparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35 .\par
the solution of the modified oseen equation with this value\par
of c then seems acceptable as the approximate solution in\par
the region intermediate between the stokes flow and the\par
free stream .  on the basis of these considerations, the authors\par
suggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exact\par
solution for the above problem as well as a solution for the plate\par

axisymmetric free mixing with swirl .\par
  viscous laminar axially-symmetric\par
free-mixing with small, moderate,\par

boundary layer type of analysis with\par
integral methods .  moderate and small\par
swirls are formally the same,\par
differing only in the order of their associated\par
radial pressure gradients .  neither\par
induces significant axial pressure gradients,.\par
consequently their effect on the\par
axial flow is negligible .  for moderate and\par
small swirl an interesting feature\par
is the swirl decay .  in both compressible\par
and incompressible flow, it is\par
shown that jet swirl decays more rapidly\par
than wake swirl whereas both swirls\par
decay more rapidly than the non-uniformity\par
in axial velocity .  large swirl\par
generates axial pressure gradients as well\par
as large radial pressure gradients,\par
and therefore alters the streamwise flow .\par

incompressible flow, show that the wake is\par
lengthened by large swirl .  it is\par
expected that this effect will be diminished\par
in the presence of higher free-stream\par

recent experimental results have shown that the\par
mixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocity\par
ratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classical\par
eddy-viscosity theory .  the theoretical analysis of two uniform\par
streams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity,\par
performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and\par
prandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing will\par
take place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding to\par
laminar diffusion .  it has been suggested that the difference\par
between analysis and experiment could be attributed to the\par
presence of a boundary layer in the experiments .  it is the\par
purpose of this note to show that the use of the classical\par
eddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer,\par
is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed\par
physically .  instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be\par
explained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, as\par
was suggested in ref. 1 .  these conclusions are obtained\par

nose drag in free-molecule flow and its minimization .\par
  the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free-molecule\par
flow involves two parameters ..  the speed ratio s between\par
ordered and random molecular motions (modified mach\par
number), and the temperature ratio between the solid surface\par
and undisturbed gas .  simplifications of the drag formula are\par
obtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremes .  to\par
minimize the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius,\par
the ordinary method of calculus of variation was found\par
inadequate .  a generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed,\par
and the specification of end conditions is discussed at length .\par
  results of the present investigation indicate that in all cases\par
an optimum nose requires a flat tip .  the optimum nose curve\par
for the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperature\par
ratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in the\par
following manner ..  for a hot body the curve is convex,. for a cold body,\par
concave .  an optimum solution exists in a restricted range of\par
specification only .  with prescribed tip and base radii the\par
admissible nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonic\par
and low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case of\par
low-subsonic cold body .  a vanishing tip radius leads to an\par
infinitely long nose in the former and a vanishing nose in the latter\par
case .\par
  optimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at the\par
low-subsonic extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, are\par
presented .  it is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with,\par
the hot-body solution asymptotically approaches\par
the hypersonic solution--i.e., a slender conventional warhead\par
with a flat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solution\par
asymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e.,\par

an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the\par

associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible\par
gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate\par
solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical\par
calculation of pai .\par
in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the\par
assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be\par
obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by\par
resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more\par
recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate\par
solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this\par
method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an\par
essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of\par
reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives\par
accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely\par
the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the\par
convective operator in the original partial differential equation\par
is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the\par
boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be\par
treated by well-known techniques .\par
it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this\par
procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the\par
axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but\par
constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the\par
von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous\par
term, rather than the linearization of the convective term . pai's\par
problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique,\par
is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .\par

the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds .\par
the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well\par
known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a\par
great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane .\par
aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one\par
component of the grand compromise that a completed\par
airplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag\par
ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind\par
tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft\par
have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true\par
that the requirements of stability and control, structure,\par
and flight operation all contribute to reducing the\par
design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values\par
which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic\par
theory .  if, however, a certain range or operating\par
efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum\par
if we examine the range equation we see that range is\par
proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive\par
efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final\par
weight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a\par
linear factor in the range equation indicates that every\par
attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,\par
the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange\par
and unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such\par
configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of\par
their geometry on the weight ratios .  in the present\par
paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio\par
problem for conventional configurations having a wing\par
and a body in close proximity to each other .  no attempt\par
will be made to select a particular configuration\par
as being the best .  however, the promising direction\par
to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with\par
the understanding that the other factors may outweight\par

distribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96 ..  1 with\par
its major axis in the direction of the incident stream .\par
the solution has been obtained by the method of hartree and\par
womersley .  in applying this method the derivatives\par
parallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, so\par
that the partial differential equation of the boundary\par
layer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocity\par
distribution through the boundary layer at one section\par
to that at another, at an interval upstream .  by two independent\par
integrations covering the same range by finite intervals\par
of different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errors\par
involved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences,\par
and so to correct for these errors .\par
  the process of solution requires the values of the pressure\par
gradient along the solid boundary, and there is a certain\par
tolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distribution\par
from a limited number of observed values of pressure .\par
an analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, and\par
the results were used for the main solution calculated .\par
it is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradient\par
so derived, does not give separation of the boundary\par
layer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separate .\par
  it is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive to\par
the pressure distribution, and a comparatively small\par
modification of the pressure distribution gives a solution which\par
does indicate separation close to the point at which\par
separation is observed to occur .  the solution with this pressure\par

on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separation .\par
  the paper presents a mathematical discussion of the\par
laminar boundary layer, which was developed with a view\par
of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers\par
in particular for which the phenomenon of separation\par
occurs .  the treatment starts with a slight modification of\par
the form of the boundary layer equation first published by\par
von mises .  two approximate solutions of this equation\par
are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the\par
boundary layer while the other is exact at the wall .  the\par
final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions\par
at the inflection points of the velocity profiles .  the final\par
solution is given in terms of a series of universal functions\par
for a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributions\par
outside of the boundary layer .  detailed calculations of\par
the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the\par
case in which the potential velocity is a linear function of\par
the distance from the upstream stagnation point .  finally\par
the complete separation point characteristics are\par
determined for the boundary layer associated with a potential\par
velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of\par
the distance from the stagnation point .  it appears that\par
extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex\par
potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using\par
the explicit formulae given in the paper .\par

the author, in conjunction with th. von karman,\par
has recently given a new method of approximate\par
integration of the prandtl boundary layer equations,\par
which was developed in order to treat cases in which\par
separation of a laminar boundary layer might be\par
expected .  the method was developed because some doubt\par
was felt as to the accuracy with which the well-known\par
pohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in the\par
neighborhood of such a separation point .  numerical\par
calculations were carried out for certain cases involving\par
theoretical simplifications, and very considerable\par
discrepancies were found between the results of the new\par
and pohlhausen methods .  the method was also used\par
in developing a theory for the maximum lift coefficient\par
of certain classes of airfoils .  this theory gave\par
satisfactory agreement with experiment but no direct\par
experimental check on the boundary layer analysis itself has\par
been given up to the present .\par

  the speed distribution in a laminar boundary layer on\par
the surface of an elliptic cylinder, of major and minor\par
axes 11.78 and 3.98 inches, respectively, has been\par
determined by means of a hot-wire anemometer .  the direction\par
of the impinging air stream was parallel to the major axis .\par
special attention was given to the speed distribution in\par
the region of separation and to the exact location of the\par
point of separation .  an approximate method, developed\par
by k. pohlhausen for computing the speed distribution,\par
the thickness of the layer, and the point of separation, is\par
described in detail,. and speed-distribution curves\par
calculated by this method are presented for comparison with\par
experiment .  good agreement is obtained along the\par
forward part of the cylinder, but pohlhausen's method fails\par
shortly before the separation point is reached and\par
consequently cannot be used to locate this point .\par

standards with the cooperation and financial assistance\par

analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminar\par

method for practical purposes of calculating the properties\par

is applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution of\par

prandtl number close to unity .  for flow in a pressure gradient,\par
the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniform\par

determining the separation point in a compressible flow with an adverse\par
pressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform wall\par

the karman-pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermal\par

the buckling of a square panel under shear, when one\par

  reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design\par
of spar with thin sheet web it is important to know\par
the load which will just cause the web to buckle .  as stiffeners\par
divide the web into panels, it is required to find the\par
buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by\par
spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners .\par
boundary conditions which represent closely this type of edge\par
fixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple support\par
critical shear stress for a square panel held in this way .\par
  conclusions and further development.--it is found that the\par
value of the critical shear stress is almost midway between\par
its values when all four edges are clamped and all four edges\par
are simply supported .\par
  the method of solution developed in this report is of very\par
general application, and can be used to investigate the\par
stability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination\par
of shear and compression or tension, and the edges\par
are clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped\par
or all simply supported .  by an easy extension the\par
method of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse\par
vibration of rectangular panels for the same types\par
of loading and edge fixing .\par

  this article proposes a new method for solving the problem\par
of the detached shock wave .  if the shock wave is assumed\par
known, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differential\par
equations arises .  this has been solved by several authors\par
in the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of\par
the shock wave) .  considering the plane stationary case, the\par
author seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation\par
function (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real .\par
in the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies a\par
hyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave) .  a\par

on the numerical calculation of detached bow shock\par

  a method is described for calculating examples of hypersonic\par
flow with a detached bow shock wave past a bluff axially\par
symmetric body .  the form of the shock wave is assumed, and the\par
analysis is based on a cauchy problem for the stream function\par
in the subsonic region, where the motion is governed by a\par
partial differential equation of elliptic type .  through analytic\par
continuation into the complex domain, the cauchy problem is\par
reformulated in such a manner that it becomes properly set in the\par
subsonic region .  this leads to a stable scheme for computation\par
of the flow by finite differences .  numerical examples at\par
freestream mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow is\par
determined throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, the\par
detachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and the\par
pressure distribution along the body are calculated .  these results are\par
in excellent agreement with experimental data obtained at the\par

shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry .\par
a study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flow\par
field develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re-\par
entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow\par
regime . the various types of flow regimes encountered down to low\par
altitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and\par
behavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed . it\par
is shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions\par
occur at a higher altitude than previously indicated . based on\par
available evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are\par
essentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes\par
 equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes\par
 except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height of\par
less than one factor of 10 in free stream density change . it is also\par
suggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs very\par
rapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the\par
transitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is\par
governed principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is\par
determined by a local mean free path .\par

  this report describes an energy method for\par
the exact solution of problems concerning the small\par
displacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panel\par
when the edges are either clamped or simply supported .\par
the influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges,\par
and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel\par
so that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle\par
surface of the panel, is taken into account .  the method\par
is not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic\par
panels when the material of the panel has two directions\par
of elastic symmetry parallel to the edges .\par
  the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of\par
linear equations for small displacement problems or on\par
an infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration\par
problems .  the important feature of the analysis given is\par
that it enables a direct approach to be made to these equations\par
in any particular problem .  it is not in general possible\par
to obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it is\par
necessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linear\par
equations or a finite determinantal equation derived from the\par
more important terms in the analytical expression for the\par
transverse displacement of the panel .  here, physical intuition\par
and, if available, experimental data serve as a guide and\par
the accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the\par
rate of convergence with the increase in the number of\par
terms considered .\par
  the general method of solution is applied first to the free\par
vibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped,\par
and second to the buckling of a square panel under shear when\par
three edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported .\par

heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of\par

in order to determine the temperature distribution over a\par
body moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of the\par
local heat-transfer coefficients is required .  for slender\par
sharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently\par
approximated by using the comparable flat-plate values .\par
however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not\par
applicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rate\par
of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its\par
value should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solution\par
is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of\par
a body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed\par
flow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has\par
been given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body moving\par
with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of\par
the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speed\par
solution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center\par
of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .\par

the plane of the plate on all four edges .  there are two\par
stiffeners attached one third and two thirds of the way\par
along the plate .  the critical load is calculated for various\par
stiffener rigidities .  also, the rigidity necessary to keep\par
the stiffeners straight when the plate buckles is found .\par
this stiffener rigidity is found to be slightly larger than\par
that necessary for a plate with one stiffener and the same\par
panel dimensions as the plate with two stiffeners .\par
  the second problem discussed by the author is that of a\par
plane, simply supported rectangular plate loaded by\par
uniformly distributed edge shearing forces in the plane of the\par
plate and linearly distributed tension and compression in\par
the plane of the plate at the ends .  the end forces vary\par
from tension, at one corner to, at the other corner,\par
so that their resultant is a bending moment .  the\par
presence of the edge shearing forces is found to diminish the\par
critical bending stress in this case .  calculations are made\par
for various magnitudes of bending and shearing forces for\par
plates of various proportions .\par
