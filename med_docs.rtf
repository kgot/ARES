correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free\par
fatty acids .                                                           \par
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of   \par
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    \par
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal   \par
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of \par
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      \par
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly\par
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        \par
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .           \par

changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the\par
course of fetal and postnatal development .                             \par
  we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat\par
foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of         \par
gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe   \par
the following\par
facts.. 1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from\par
the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .  \par
  2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820\par
during the same period .                                                \par
  3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700\par
ug) and increases abruptly at birth .                                   \par
  4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the\par
18th day of foetal life .                                               \par
  5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the           \par
development .                                                           \par
  6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the        \par
development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of   \par
foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,  \par
  - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal\par
life,. stage of cellular reorganisation,\par
  - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through      \par
hyperplasia and hypertrophy .                                           \par

surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .                               \par
  lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have\par
a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid         \par
contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near     \par
term, but less surface activity in premature lambs .                    \par
  administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to   \par
delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal  \par
fluid .                                                                 \par
  two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146   \par
and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was        \par
phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .              \par
  the investigations reported here offer a model for further research   \par
into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline       \par

placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum    \par
twins, a stillborn and a live-born .                                    \par
  1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,        \par
triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood \par
in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .        \par
  2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord     \par
blood triglyceride and nefa levels .                                    \par
  3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much      \par
triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .  \par
  4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the        \par
stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which   \par
includes determinations on 26 live births .                             \par

free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat     \par

  subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female     \par
sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma   \par
free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of\par
pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily         \par
throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 \par
and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the   \par
fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the  \par
maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat     \par
accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in\par
babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally    \par
high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .                   \par

the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal   \par
plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .          \par
  determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of     \par
pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the       \par
concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - \par
22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of       \par
non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the     \par
maternal values .                                                       \par
  with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the           \par
concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while\par
at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with     \par
slightly increased average values .                                     \par
  whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of    \par
non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of   \par
pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of         \par
non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .              \par

lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy .                      \par
  the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from     \par
serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and  \par
third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild\par
and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at  \par
term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition .\par
in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the \par
rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension .   \par
serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . \par
total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of      \par
preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from \par
animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis .                 \par

essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the         \par

  we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the  \par
newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of\par
acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically .                 \par
  we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the       \par
placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the     \par
newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend.\par

acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .   \par
  slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks   \par
have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by        \par
addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not  \par
possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver        \par
mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are\par
injured during isolation .                                              \par

intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep \par

  from the results of our previous and present studied on the           \par
transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron   \par
microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .                     \par
  1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without        \par
dissociation .                                                          \par
  2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the       \par
biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the       \par
authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the\par
basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors       \par
believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of\par
biological transportation of materials through the placenta .           \par

the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,\par
maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .                   \par
  thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver     \par
showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of\par
the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content \par
of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined    \par
(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .         \par
  as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a    \par
little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is       \par
conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .  \par
on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother\par
rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all       \par
phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight  \par
rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .               \par
  the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats\par
occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, \par
moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . \par
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond\par
to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is \par
higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops      \par
towards the 22nd day .                                                  \par

  lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract\par
were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an\par
intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  \par
rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an\par
age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium \par
was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     \par
lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  \par
their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei   \par
are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant    \par
peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the \par
beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was \par
observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks   \par
was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be   \par
interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .      \par

  the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was  \par
studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation   \par
into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by\par
reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation  \par
followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .         \par
specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens\par
material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial  \par
sections . the results were interpreted as\par
follows.. 1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,\par
embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of      \par
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail  \par
to undergo any fiber formation .                                        \par
  2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants \par
will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular         \par
differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes    \par
necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these  \par
responses .                                                             \par

for their complete autonomous maturation .                              \par

corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome .                  \par
  the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26 \par
adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjects   \par
were observed in this series, and 18 additional cases were summarized   \par
from the literature . twenty-two of the patients were male and four were\par
female . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instances  \par

primary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis .                      \par
  the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an average    \par
survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease  \par
was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    \par
syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       \par
purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension\par
(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        \par
inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  \par
and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis \par
was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with \par

the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis       \par
diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the\par

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.\par
  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   \par
antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    \par
individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin \par
clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       \par
weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   \par
its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    \par
slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said\par
to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  \par
sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying \par
the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .                          \par
  1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic        \par
syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater  \par
than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to     \par
steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes \par
observed on renal biopsy .                                              \par
  2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic        \par
syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of    \par
proteinuria .                                                           \par
  3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a    \par
given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .        \par
  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    \par
total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains\par
fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      \par
excreted .                                                              \par
  5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   \par
the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       \par
disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .            \par
  6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial \par
blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     \par
protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        \par
initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type \par
or better .                                                             \par
  7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and\par
has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is         \par
unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin   \par
clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with  \par

enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several \par
metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        \par
variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,  \par

a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     \par
women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     \par

the development of social attachments in infancy .                      \par
  this report is devoted to the formation and development of social     \par
attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment\par
function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the        \par
proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most     \par
suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the     \par
individual when deprived of such proximity .                            \par
  the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60     \par
infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks \par
on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with \par
the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation      \par
situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age \par
at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and\par
the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of     \par
fear-of-strangers was also included .                                   \par
  results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     \par
generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  \par
this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that\par
the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  \par
following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    \par
cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity \par
of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  \par
specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   \par
cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment        \par
variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,\par
and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at  \par
proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the \par
conditions necessary to terminate protest .                             \par
  individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were  \par
explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were       \par
examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions   \par
made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the     \par
attachment function .                                                   \par

quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  \par

  the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       \par

nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                       \par

  the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        \par
intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been\par
characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is\par
achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   \par
are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   \par
rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    \par
afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   \par
azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    \par
possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from\par
fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      \par
prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of\par
the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact     \par

certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be           \par

massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical        \par

antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the\par
entodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and      \par
pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the     \par
common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific     \par
cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer  \par
antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .              \par

aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26     \par
patients show no significant difference . however, there were four      \par
instances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to the  \par
observation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when the\par

trichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this is       \par
followed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of the         \par

converted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction \par
(microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma without\par
appreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it is   \par

the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice .                \par
  the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied by       \par
electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza \par
virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations  \par
by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy in\par
order to evaluate the lesions produced .                                \par
  at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of   \par
alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed     \par
basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the        \par
blood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the   \par
alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in   \par
complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after        \par
infection .                                                             \par

3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed        \par
considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmic\par
edema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and \par
were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,  \par
both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into \par
the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and \par

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .          \par
  the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains            \par
characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but  \par
basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting     \par
membrane of the unit type .                                             \par
  inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation  \par
which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . some\par
inclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called\par
/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented     \par
suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved \par
in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated  \par
with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion      \par
bodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by        \par
accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar     \par
space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number    \par
late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the     \par
cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened \par
type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .                        \par
  on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion      \par
bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is     \par
concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during  \par
remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .                      \par
  the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary      \par
surfactant is discussed .                                               \par

follows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the     \par
/heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically    \par
significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, \par

treated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 \par
control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in\par
10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between  \par
control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial  \par
increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,        \par
although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in   \par
this disease .                                                          \par

change of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that of     \par
cardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal blood     \par
shift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . this   \par
implies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced by     \par
posture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probably\par
adjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output \par

65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in the        \par
remaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min when \par
the rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .\par
  3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in the\par
arterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in the\par
jugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of the           \par
experiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of co   \par
administration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percent  \par
and 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experiment     \par
where the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89   \par
percent of the rise in p .                                              \par
  4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in the\par
rise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay was     \par
about 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from\par
1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .                                             \par
  5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in p  \par
in all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constants    \par
which varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow component    \par
with time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .          \par
  the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the time        \par
constants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3 \par
min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .\par
  6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilation\par
following co administration is due to stimulation of an area in the     \par
antero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p   \par
(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation is    \par
affected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can be         \par
predicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administration  \par
will take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise in\par
ventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise of      \par
arterial and jugular venous p .                                         \par

cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis of  \par

be detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such as    \par

  when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used as\par
an anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,  \par

followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced by \par
pentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of ether     \par
anesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbits\par

dog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was         \par
hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or  \par

factors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings of\par
the mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who were   \par
highly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personality\par
ratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was a   \par
significant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groups  \par

finding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motor\par
scale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment the       \par
difference was not statistically significant . also, the children from  \par
the /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a more\par
favorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /high    \par
anxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of children   \par

well on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotional      \par

  in any group of poor readers, a large percentage will have ocular,    \par
neurologic, psychiatric or psychologic abnormalities and/or a strong    \par
hereditary tendency . the degree to which reading can be learned depends\par
upon the ability of the individual to adjust to the psycho-physiologic  \par
needs that are present at the time he reaches /reading age/ in school . \par
if compensating abilities are present, and if the child's reaction is a \par

not, he may become a /poor reader/ . these children should be recognized\par

  a complete medical work-up should be managed by an ophthalmologist . a\par
complete ophthalmic examination should first be performed and all       \par
possible visual anomalies should be corrected . the ophthalmologist may \par
want a psychometric evaluation, a neurologic opinion to determine the   \par
role of organic brain damage, psychiatric consultation for evaluation of\par
emotional disturbances, pediatric consultation for evaluation of the    \par
status of the general health and/or consultation by an otolaryngologist \par
to determine the patient's hearing ability . with all the necessary     \par
information at hand, the ophthalmologist will be able to recommend      \par
corrective medical therapy and to advise the parents and teachers about \par
available remedial reading aids .                                       \par

frontal lobes and vision .                                              \par
  the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on the \par
presentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a right  \par
frontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was a  \par
pronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the\par
patient,. gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of full\par
visual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this and \par
psychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (which   \par
latter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of those    \par
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to the    \par
findings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipital        \par
connections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe  \par
(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of a    \par
temporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectual  \par
deficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, our   \par
case would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination of      \par
symptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will prompt \par
other long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continued   \par
observation of this patient and perhaps of others will give a           \par
possibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,\par
as has been assumed for animals .                                       \par

  1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipital   \par
electrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45      \par
normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasic      \par
potential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67  \par
percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percent \par
later waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertex  \par
reference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found in \par
normal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side compared  \par
to larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation the            \par
contralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflecting  \par
predominant retinal representation of the temporal field .              \par
  2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression in   \par
wave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defects   \par
involving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screen      \par

  3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration or \par
loss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .                \par
  4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppression  \par
of ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .             \par
  5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with complete      \par
suppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease is        \par
probably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .                          \par
  6. involvement of nasal retinal fibres is indicated by reversal of the\par
normal contralateral preponderance of ver on monocular stimulation .    \par
these changes are observed in chiasmal disease .                        \par

optokinetic nystagmus and occipital lesions .                           \par
  six cases are presented to invalidate the rule that horizontally      \par
symmetric optokinetic responses indicate a vascular etiology in patients\par
with occipital lobe type hemianopias . the converse of this rule is, in \par
our experience, still a valuable observation . that is, asymmetry of    \par
horizontal optokinetic responses accompanying an occipital type field   \par
defect is a strong indication of a mass lesion . optokinetic nystagmus  \par
may be helpful, therefore, as corroborative evidence in diagnosing      \par
occipital lobe tumor but not in ruling it out .                         \par

  1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to the\par
extent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas . \par
the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensory \par
impairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia and        \par
difficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause the   \par
wide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,     \par
among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found in        \par
association with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . an    \par
even more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads to      \par
complete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3, \par
4 and 5) .                                                              \par
  2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack of        \par
differentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstract\par
verbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasic      \par
syndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis by        \par
application of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit the    \par
impairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be well           \par
compensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of an   \par
aphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .                     \par
  3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated along        \par
quantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding and      \par
naming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected, \par
understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preserved       \par
function (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions is     \par
found with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding and \par
naming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration than        \par
understanding and naming of any other categories of words (all cases    \par
presented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasia  \par
with some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated with \par
acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may  \par
represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited  \par
to finger aphasia .                                                     \par
  4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from other        \par
categories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,        \par
vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologic      \par
background . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in the     \par
initial development of the understanding of words defining the body     \par
image .                                                                 \par
  in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasic         \par
impairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categories  \par
of words, seem to confirm this assumption .                             \par

  radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and through         \par
short-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can be     \par
assessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because of \par
the large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the course\par
of treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variations   \par
from the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structural\par
aberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grown     \par
prior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us to        \par
determine the variation .                                               \par

chromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specific         \par
aberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to be   \par

simmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patients    \par
under the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed to       \par
measure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material . \par
these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in their  \par
care of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .       \par
  the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomes        \par
involved during his hospitalization should provide some indication of   \par
the extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics have   \par
been effective . more formal estimates can be obtained by               \par
re-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodic        \par
intervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such as\par
this must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult are      \par
usually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they develop  \par
new habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparent     \par
fixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,\par
experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioral         \par

degree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing can     \par

  clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,  \par
and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequently       \par
obscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterization  \par
and angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a complete  \par
diagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incomplete        \par
diagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was made      \par
preoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . while \par
the diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexist \par
with ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography and    \par
selective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpful \par
in identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septal  \par
defect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, including   \par
left-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricular                \par
angiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases in \par

  clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and hemodynamic findings\par
in 12 children with the combination of a ventricular septal defect and  \par
aortic insufficiency are presented . the left-to-right shunt was        \par
determined to be small or moderate in all, and significant aortic       \par
insufficiency was documented by aortography in 11 patients . clinical   \par
indication of aortic insufficiency as manifested by an aortic diastolic \par

  the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings in      \par
fifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aortic   \par
regurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations the  \par
aortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aortic \par
valve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of the    \par
septal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be more     \par
important to the development of this complication than the size of the  \par
defect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aortic   \par
regurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends to \par
become more severe . careful observation of patients with these defects \par
is indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation since     \par
rapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .  \par
ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguished\par
from other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressure \par
with a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization and    \par
thoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in this \par
differentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defect  \par

effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance direct  \par
determinations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .\par
  the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on the           \par
performance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14      \par
patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneous   \par
forward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured with \par
a sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with left          \par
ventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aortic     \par
regurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the total\par
forward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . the \par
calculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .   \par
after replacement of the aortic valve with a starr-edwards prosthesis,  \par
the absence of regurgitant flow was proved in every patient, and the    \par
records of aortic blood flow closely resembled those seen in patients   \par
with normal aortic valves . net forward blood flow increased by an      \par
average of 60 percent, total left ventricular stroke volume fell 42     \par
percent, and the mean aortic pressure rose 29 percent . the pressure    \par
work of the left ventricle was elevated preoperatively in five of the   \par
eight patients (average 89 g-m stroke/m ) and fell significantly to an  \par
average of 34 g-m stroke m after valve replacement . kinetic ventricular\par
work was high in seven of the eight patients and comprised 10 percent of\par
total work before replacement but only 4.8 percent afterward .          \par
  similar observations were made in five patients with aortic stenosis  \par
and associated aortic regurgitation, ranging in severity from 24 to 72  \par
percent of total forward stroke volume . in four patients in whom the   \par
valve was replaced, no residual regurgitation was present afterward, and\par
net forward flow rose an average of 49 percent . kinetic left           \par
ventricular work was extremely high in every patient and averaged 26    \par
percent of total work preoperatively and 13 percent after valve         \par
replacement . in this group, pressure work was variable both before and \par
after operation .                                                       \par

  the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was found\par
to be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan and \par
roentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluid  \par
this ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases of \par
effusion of 200 cc or more .                                            \par

  in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays, \par
the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells of       \par
transfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .         \par
  labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,    \par
readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/ \par
1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51  \par
hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond this   \par
time, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .     \par
  labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite the\par
presence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structure    \par
after irradiation .                                                     \par
  the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as the       \par
parenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75\par
hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, the       \par
average density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded to     \par
values expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . the   \par

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deep        \par
hypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .                                   \par
  1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients within  \par
the body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basal   \par
blood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portion\par
of the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .                \par

total body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperature\par
difference and the extracorporeal flow rate .                           \par

arrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average body           \par
temperature .                                                           \par
  5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production of    \par
lactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impair      \par
lactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive in      \par
prolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatory\par
arrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profound      \par
cooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .              \par
  6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchange   \par
during perfusion cooling .                                              \par

experiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference to \par
the relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its sm     \par
dependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the spores    \par
formed . the results are as follows .                                   \par
  1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about     \par
3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found as   \par
its mutant .                                                            \par

below 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/m\par
l, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .          \par
  3. sm resistant type grows well between sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, the\par
growth declines rapidly at about sm 10,000 r/ml .                       \par
  4. sm dependent type shows normal growth between sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/m\par
l, the growth get worth below sm 10 r/ml, and the cell shape elongates  \par
several times, at sm below 1 r/ml each cell becomes filamentous form and\par
has several ten times length of normal cell, as if the cells have       \par
stopped to divide at low sm concentration .                             \par
  6. the germination and outgrowth of spores of the sm dependent type   \par
slow down with decline of sm concentration, but the germinated spores   \par
grow in normal forms until sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, then the  \par
germination becomes much slower, and the cells grow in filamentous forms\par
or irregular forms . at extremely low sm concentration both germination \par

subjects but also in quite a number of postmenopausal patients,         \par
particularly in those who were still excreting significant amounts of   \par
oestrogens . this decrease in the oestrogen output was transient and was\par
followed by a compensatory increase, possibly of adrenal origin .       \par
  cortisone administered within a month after the oophorectomy at a     \par
dosage of 50 mg per day rapidly depressed the secondary rise in the     \par
oestrogen output to a level of about 4 to 5 ug/24 h irrespective of the \par
age of the patient . this excretion level was unchanged as long as      \par

the immunosuppressive action of melphalan in adult cba-p mice challenged\par
with a-strain mammary carcinoma transplants . this was true when the    \par
thymectomy was performed 2 days, 4 weeks or 7 weeks prior to injection  \par
of a single dose (15 mg/kg body weight) of melphalan, administered 24   \par

studies on the kinetics of transplantation immunity .                   \par
  using the parameter of the number of tumor cells necessary to produce \par
s.c. tumors in allogeneic animals at varying intervals after antigenic  \par
stimulation, immunity was found to be in force as early as 2 days after \par
primary antigenic stimulation . it reached a peak at 8-10 days and had  \par
largely subsided by the end of a month . this method was also applied to\par
the quantitative study of the onset, degree, and duration of immunity   \par
elicited by skin grafts . the results obtained with inocula of large    \par
numbers of tumor cells (10 percent) were comparable to those obtained   \par
with massive skin grafts .                                              \par
  the differences in the degree of antigenic stimulation resulting from \par
different routes of inoculation were studied . it was found that the    \par
intradermal (i.d.) route of inoculation resulted in a more intense      \par
antigenic stimulation than the s.c. route . when both routes of         \par
inoculation were used simultaneously the pattern of growth of the\par
s.c. tumor was influenced by the i.d. inoculation.. an i.d. inoculum given 24\par
or 48 hr earlier caused marked suppression of growth of the s.c. tumor, \par
while when an i.d. inoculation was preceded by an s.c. inoculation,     \par
although there was an appreciable effect on the growth size, the growth \par
curves of the 2 tumors were always parallel .                           \par

  cells isolated from primary benzo(a)pyrene-induced fibrosarcomas in   \par

when injected back into the autochthonous host . the autograft did not  \par
take if the primary tumor had been removed but grew occasionally in     \par
animals in which the major part of the tumor was left . in every        \par
instance the sarcoma cells grew when injected into syngeneic recipients \par
in these recipients the growth of the sarcoma cells was prevented or  \par
retarded when they were mixed in vitro, prior to injection, with spleen \par
cells from animals that had been immunized against the tumor .          \par
autochthonous spleen cells taken from the animal with the tumor behaved \par
in this test like those from immunized animals as long as the spleen was\par
taken 3 weeks after removal of the tumor . when the spleen and tumor    \par
were removed at the same time, however, autochthonous spleen cells did  \par
not behave like spleen cells from immunized animals and did not         \par
interfere with the growth of the tumor . the results of both the        \par
autograft and spleen cell experiments suggest that rats react actively  \par
against their own growing primary tumors, but that the tumor exhausts   \par
the supply of lymphocytes responsible for this reaction . after the     \par

  increased ruminal pressure had little effect on cerebral blood flow   \par

phages . on the basis of bacteriocin production the examined strains    \par
were divided into two groups .                                          \par
  (iv) several temperate phages isolated in our laboratory were         \par
presumably identical with phage pbs 1 . phage sp 10 differed from these \par
agents both in antigenic structure and in host range .                  \par
  (v) transduction by some lysates of pbs 1-type phages was observed at \par
frequencies of the order of 10 . considerably more and less effective   \par
phage materials were yielded by some lysogenic transductants . thus     \par
transducing phages active in the order of 10 were prepared .            \par
  (vi) transduction frequency, in addition to the properties of the     \par
phage, was influenced by the physiological condition of bacteria .      \par

the carrier state of bacillus subtilis infected with the transducing    \par
bacteriophage sp10 .                                                    \par
  bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis to form a carrier     \par
system . the infected bacteria give rise to infected organisms after six\par
or more successive single-colony isolations . about 60 of the spores    \par
derived from such an infected culture yield clones that produce phage,  \par
and such spores retain their ability to produce phage even after        \par
treatment with antiserum and heating at 80 . four hours' incubation of  \par
carrier spores in nutrient broth yields cultures having more than 10    \par
infective centers per bacterium . cultivation of infected organisms in  \par
medium containing sp10 antiserum leads to loss of phage and loss of     \par
immunity to phage infection . dna with a density characteristic of viral\par
dna can be detected in infected bacteria . extracts of infected bacteria\par
contain a phage-induced deoxyribonuclease activity which attacks both   \par
phage and bacterial dna in vitro . the phage-bacterial complex is       \par
therefore best described as a carrier state .                           \par
  the dna of the phage and of b. subtilis are chemically different .    \par
enzymatically prepared complementary virus rna has no homology with     \par
bacterial dna . the lack of homology of this transducing phage dna with \par
the dna of its host and the failure to form a truly lysogenic           \par
relationship reinforce previous conclusions that transducing bacterial  \par
dna is incorporated into the sp10 virus particle without any            \par
recombination between viral and bacterial dna .                         \par

infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .\par
  sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, is         \par
described . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in the \par
density of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilis\par
strain sb-1 .                                                           \par
  dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weight     \par
equivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130 \par
x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, is   \par
infective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-forming     \par
ability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules are     \par
required to initiate an infective center . recombination studies with   \par
mixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm the\par
existence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a second    \par
infective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . in \par
this system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to the     \par
cells . at these concentrations the multiple-event nature of phage dna  \par
infection precludes the formation of unaided plaques . however, by      \par
subsequently superinfecting the dna-infected cells with a               \par
temperature-sensitive mutant and plating under selective conditions,    \par
genetic rescue of the infecting dna is accomplished and detected .      \par
infective centers elicited by this /marker rescue/ phenomenon are       \par
directly proportional to dna concentration . the time of attainment of  \par
dnase resistance by phage dna infective centers that have irreversibly  \par
adsorbed dna can be measured . phage dna infective centers require at   \par
least 13 minutes to become totally dnase resistant . the reasons for the\par
failure of single phage dna molecules to carry out an infection are     \par
discussed in terms of a specific breakage-reunion                       \par

psychology of children's dental treatment .                             \par
  the communication deals with influences involved in the development of\par
the child's attitude to dental treatment . they are extrinsic           \par
(educational etc.) and intrinsic (constitutional and hereditary) . their\par
understanding helps to determine the correct psychological policy for   \par
the management of the child in the surgery .                            \par
  the aim of psychology applied in dentistry is to discover a mode of   \par
treatment procedure which would ensure that the child will not be       \par
subject to any psychic traumatization (psychophylaxis) . its second aim \par
is the management of the so called difficult child and his treatment .  \par
  to understand better the child's frame of mind during dental treatment\par
the situation in the surgery is dealt with step by step as the child    \par
experiences it through his senses and his psyche . beside the basic     \par
senses -dash hearing and seeing -dash others are also affected.. touch  \par
(pressure sensation), smell and taste .                                 \par
  children during dental treatment are nearly always in a state of      \par
raised emotional tension and are susceptible to anxiety reactions .     \par
according to the degree of fear which they manifest children may be     \par
classed into categories of cooperating and difficult patients . the     \par
psychological procedure for the treatment of children of both groups is \par
based on the principles summarized in the section 'psychophylaxis in    \par
dentistry' . in difficult children it is often necessary to employ yet  \par
other psychological measures-psychotherapy, suggestion etc . in         \par
extremely exacting cases premedication helps sometimes to find contact  \par
with the child .                                                        \par
  the experimental part of the work demonstrates the following findings \par
 1. dental treatment consists of a series of interdependent           \par
traumatizing impulses . many of them appear only after a close analysis \par
of the situation . 2. the adverse response similar to that elicited by  \par
pain may be due also to sensory impressions with a negative emotional   \par
background . 3. psychic traumatization of the child during dental       \par
treatment can be prevented by relatively simple psychological measures .\par

time and mean birth weight, and the personality differences between     \par

to 160 obstetric patients at the beginning of the third trimester of    \par
pregnancy, with the mmpi and taylor being readministered post partum .  \par
reliable group personality changes observed from pre- to postdelivery   \par
supported the contention that pregnancy is a time of emotional upset .  \par
  following delivery, each patient was classified as normal or abnormal \par
dependent on the clinical course of parturition, delivery, and condition\par
of the offspring . there were no significant differences between these  \par
groups with respect to age or intelligence . reliable differences were  \par
found, however, for manifest anxiety and total labor times . in         \par
addition, a positive relationship was found between manifest anxiety and\par
birth weights . personality differences found at predelivery between the\par
subgroups were largely attributable to the abnormal group's greater     \par
neuroticism, anxiety, and use of the ruminative ego defenses .          \par
  post partum, the personality characteristics of the subgroups were    \par
quite similar . both groups showed greater personality stability        \par
following delivery, with the most striking changes from predelivery     \par
demonstrable in the abnormal group . the magnitude of these changes were\par
interpreted as emotional lability and related to obstetric complications\par
by activation of various physiological regulator systems .              \par

have been observed who show points of striking similarity . we recognise\par
in them a well-defined type that is clearly distinguishable from other  \par

psychological effects of circumcision .                                 \par

small study was arranged in which twelve children, from average and low \par
socio-economic level, were given goodenough dam test, cat, rorschach and\par
two sets of stories, prior to the operation and following it . the      \par
results of the tests showed that circumcision, performed around the     \par
phallic stage is perceived by the child as an act of aggression and     \par
castration . it has detrimental effects on the child's functioning and  \par
adaptation, particularly on his ego strength . by weakening the         \par
controlling and defensive mechanisms of the ego, and initiating         \par
regression, it loosens the previously hidden fears, anxieties, and      \par
instinctual impulses, and renders a feeling of reality to them . what is\par
expressed following the operation is primitive, archaic, and            \par
unsocialized in character . as a defensive control and protection       \par
against the surge of the instinctual forces coming from within and the  \par
threats coming from outside, the ego of the child seeks safety in total \par
withdrawal, thus isolates and insulates itself from disturbing stimuli .\par

  changes in 387 children's behavior following hospitalization were     \par
evaluated by means of a questionnaire sent to parents a week after      \par

regression, (ii) separation anxiety, (iii) anxiety about sleep, (iv)    \par
eating disturbance, (v) aggression toward authority, and (vi)           \par
apathy-withdrawal . scores for these six factors (types of responses) as\par

hospitalization, degree of pain experienced during hospitalization, and \par

any analysis . age, duration of hospitalization, and occupational status\par
were each significantly related to one or more types of responses .     \par
comparison of the mean factor and total scores for the full sample with \par

involved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes have  \par
revealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate . \par
comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from various \par
vertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the number\par
of ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,  \par
and in their electrophoretic mobilities . during development of chick,  \par
rabbit, and human tissues characteristic sequential alterations in the  \par
ldh isozyme pattern occurred and consisted for liver and muscle in loss \par
of the most rapidly migrating anodal bands and increased activity in the\par
cathodal bands and slower migrating anodal bands . in heart the reverse \par
changes were observed . if high enough ldh activities of early fetal    \par
tissue extracts were applied to the gel the full complement of ldh      \par
isozymes was observed,. however, in lower concentrations the cathodal   \par
bands, which in the starch gel disappear more rapidly on dilution than  \par
do the anodal bands, were not observed . a species-specific isozyme     \par
pattern is obtained in long term culture of rabbit, chick, and human    \par
cells . independently of the tissue of origin, there occurs in cells in \par
culture a sequential series of isozyme alterations characterized by     \par
decreased intensity of rapidly migrating anodal bands . the shift toward\par
prominence of cathodal isozymes during both fetal development and tissue\par
culture can be explained by postulating the increased activity of the   \par
gene producing one of the subunits of ldh with a concomitant decrease in\par
the activity of the gene producing the second subunit . practical       \par
applications of the study of isozymes in tissue culture were discussed .\par

in only few cases in the kidney . hyperplasias and neoplasias grading   \par
into lung primary carcinoma have been found in the lung in r. pipiens . \par
temperatures below 15 c. protected animals from lung as well as kidney  \par
disease . higher temperatures disturbed the host-parasite relationships \par
and led to higher incidence of malignancy . in the bullfrog, precancer  \par
was clearly associated with the worm attachment discs .                 \par
  (3) other histological types of tumors in vermont frogs included      \par
lymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, and adrenal and \par
cartilage tumors of uncertain malignancy .                              \par
  (4) improved methods of obtaining tumor filtrates allowed greater     \par
probability of inducing malignancy with direct renal injection . in 106 \par
frogs 37 per cent developed histologically provable cancers in the      \par
ranges of three to seven months . twenty-six per cent showed some       \par
pre-cancer response and 43 per cent were negative . within the series   \par
receiving filtrate from high malignancy donors one group yielded 100 per\par
cent positive, the others 50 and 38 per cent, respectively .            \par
  (5) among animals injected with /low/ malignancy filtrate, fewer      \par
tumors resulted . some of these were clearly vesicular carcinomas and   \par
could be classed as lung tumors .                                       \par
  (6) improved tissue culture methods allowed explants to live in liquid\par
media under perforated cellophane up to one year . slower growth, aided \par
by lower temperatures (16 c.) improved the microecology of cell types   \par
and allowed detailed daily observations of each cell's intranuclear and \par
intranucleolar physiology for extended time-lapse cine-photography .    \par

however, the most successful cases showed varying degrees of inhibition \par
and retardation of lens regeneration .                                  \par
  4. pairs of eyes were united at large adjacent wound openings to      \par
provide a common reservoir of aqueous humor bathing both lenses and     \par
dorsal irises . in some cases the eyes were placed on the side of the   \par
body . in others more successful unions were made by fusing a           \par
transplanted eye to the right eye of a host .                           \par
  5. approximately three months after operation one of two large lens   \par
regenerates in a pair of perfectly fused eyes was removed . six weeks   \par
later a new large lens regenerate reappeared in most of the             \par
lentectomized units in the presence of the intact lens of the other unit\par
  6. there is a strong possibility that the more than normal amount of  \par
neural retina present provided a more powerful retinal factor for lens  \par
regeneration than the inhibiting influence of the intact lens in the    \par
environment .                                                           \par

neurological manifestations .                                           \par
  neurologic manifestations are frequent in patients who have sickle    \par
cell disease . these manifestations may be the earliest presenting signs\par
and symptoms and they are so variable that the patient may be           \par
erroneously diagnosed as having conditions such as meningitis,          \par
poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage,    \par
lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and congenital      \par
malformations of the brain . furthermore, development of these          \par
manifestations cannot be predicted on the basis of the type of crisis   \par
involved .                                                              \par
  prognosis following neurological involvement is unpredictable, but    \par
recurrent episodes, together with abnormal electroencephalographic      \par
readings suggest a poor outcome . such patients die or are the victims  \par
of rather severe neurological deficits .                                \par
  neurological examination of these patients suggests diffuse           \par
involvement of the cerebral hemispheres . examination of the            \par
pathological material, however, often fails to reveal thromboses . the  \par
striking findings are infarcts in the white matter and perivascular     \par
hemorrhages .                                                           \par
  the thesis that the abnormal neurological findings in these patients  \par
are actually due to sickle cell disease is supported by the fact that   \par
all such symptoms appear in association with clinical circumstances     \par
known to induce sickling . these include surgery and anesthesia, fever  \par

implications of gerstmann's syndrome .                                  \par
  of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery of    \par
neuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann's \par
syndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic brain\par
dysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number of      \par
gerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended to \par
be larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greater      \par
neurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann components  \par
had associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and the \par
lesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of the   \par
patient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,   \par
but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasia \par
in agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling out   \par
the four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is also\par
prepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrent     \par
deficits are also separate syndromes .                                  \par
  in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,  \par
the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved by\par
the lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere contained\par
a lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and the     \par
probability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area also  \par
increased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . with\par
two, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were never        \par
restricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over the    \par
parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,\par
gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency as    \par
dysphasia .                                                             \par

cortisone and atypical pulmonary /epithelial/ hyperplasia further       \par
studies including electron microscopy, tissue culture, animal           \par
transplantation and long term observations .                            \par
  previous work in rabbits showed that there was a proliferation of     \par
cells within pulmonary alveoli following intratracheal injection of     \par
nitric acid and that the proliferation was greatly enhanced by the      \par
administration of cortisone to the animals .                            \par
  electron microscopic observations indicated that these were           \par
morphologically large alveolar lining cells . tissue culture studies of \par
damaged and normal lung with and without cortisone showed no evidence   \par
for a direct effect of the drug on the proliferation of these cells .   \par
  this observation, together with the knowledge that fibrosis was       \par
delayed in the cortisone treated animals, support the thesis that the   \par
cortisone effect is an indirect one . transplantation of damaged lung   \par
tissue to hamster cheek pouch failed to reveal evidence of growth .     \par
within the period of observation (99 to 420 days) there was evidence    \par
that the proliferation subsided considerably and no neoplasms developed \par

lactate and pyruvate in the brain of rats during hyperventilation .     \par
  experiments on anesthetized and curarized rats under artificial       \par
ventilation show that during hyperventilation lactate and pyruvate are  \par
markedly increased both in blood and in brain . the lactate/pyruvate    \par
ratio which remains in blood the same as in control conditions, is      \par
systematically decreased in brain . during hypoxia (ventilation with 7  \par
oxygen in nitrogen) lactate rises markedly in blood and in brain . the  \par
lactate/pyruvate ratio which is strongly increased in blood shows a     \par
small rise in brain . these observations could indicate that a different\par
mechanism is responsible for the rise of lactate in brain during hypoxia\par
and hyperventilation . the important augmentation of lactate in brain   \par
during hyperventilation can give an explanation for the delayed rise    \par
which is seen in the lactate level in cerebrospinal fluid in these      \par

mitral atresia associated with pulmonary venous anomalies .             \par

form of anomalous pulmonary venous connexion . in the remaining case the\par
pulmonary venous anomaly was represented by cor triatriatum . in 3      \par
(group i), mitral atresia and premature closure of the foramen ovale    \par
coexisted . the anomalous pulmonary venous connexions in this group     \par
provided collateral routes for the flow of pulmonary venous blood, and  \par
can be understood as developing en response to obstruction at the       \par

surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect .                       \par
  the surgical technique of closure of ventricular septal defects in 80 \par
cases (37 cases of isolated defects and 43 cases of tetralogy of fallot)\par
is discussed in the light of the follow-up results . the use of a patch \par
for closure has reduced the incidence of recurrence to 4 percent, com-  \par
pared with 18 percent when direct suture was performed . the incidence  \par
of heart block also decreased from 15 percent, when direct suture was   \par
used, to 4 percent with a patch . the transatrial approach is preferred \par
for isolated ventricular septal defects,. the ventricular approach is   \par
preferred for cases with tetralogy of fallot . in cases combined with   \par
aortic insufficiency only small defects are closed through the aorta .  \par
larger defects are closed in the usual way at a first stage operation,  \par
and a total valve prosthesis is introduced at a second operation . there\par

  in sonre small ventricular septal defect, we tried the vasoactive     \par
drugs . phenylephrine was injected slowly into the right ventricle via  \par
the catheter, a rapid rise in femoral arterial pressure associated with \par
bradycardia and intensiffication of the systolic murmur was observed .  \par
after the administration of amyl nitrite, a rapid fall in femoral       \par
arterial pressure associated with tachycardia and softening of the sys- \par
tolic murmur was observed .                                             \par
  in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   \par
slowly from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, the outstanding        \par
pressure curve is recorded in ductus arteriosus . the systolic pressure \par
curve in the ductus arteriosus is the same as the systolic pressure in  \par
the aorta and the diastolic pressure curve in the ductus arteriosus has \par
a diastolic dip followed by a late diastolic pressure peak .            \par
  in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   \par
from the left pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, the pressure     \par
curve reveals a considerable characteristic rise in pulmonary arterial  \par
pressure which is regarded as an effect of the transmission of systemic \par
pressure through the ductus arteriosus .                                \par

its maximal vector and the t-loop oriented more than 120 in horizontal  \par
plane was usually accompanied by abnormal inscription . percentage of   \par

pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies .              \par
  an attempt was made to test the theory that in pulmonary arterial     \par
hypertension, the plexiform lesion is a jet lesion beyond points of     \par
arterial stenosis resulting from nonspecific intimal thickening .       \par
  in 39 subjects with such congenital communications as are associated  \par
with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the lungs were studied            \par
histologically . in each, there was an additional element of pulmonary  \par
venous obstruction . it is likely that in the absence of pulmonary      \par
venous obstruction, adult patients with only the congenital             \par
communication would have developed plexiform lesions .                  \par
  in the three adult patients in the study, no plexiform lesions were   \par
identified . among the 36 infants or children, one subject showed       \par
plexiform lesions, a 53-day-old girl with mitral atresia, ventricular   \par
septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus .                           \par

regarding the genesis of plexiform lesions, the findings in the one     \par

drugs and neonatal jaundice .                                           \par
  this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubin       \par
metabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggerated      \par
physiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader is       \par
referred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mention \par
has been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute to \par
the development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-soluble  \par
vitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, and  \par
novobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborn\par
infant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds will     \par
definitely be incriminated .                                            \par
  it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to a    \par
mother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrations  \par
of the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered to   \par
the nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbed  \par
by the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to the\par
newborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoid\par
what may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .                      \par

amputation in patients over 80 years of age .                           \par
  although patients over 80 years of age can be expected to have poor   \par
physical reserve and many co-existing diseases, our observations show   \par
that nevertheless they can be subjected to surgical procedures without  \par
undue mortality . the mortality rate can be maintained at a minimum if  \par
the surgeon considers the factors that contribute to its increase in the\par
elderly . this necessitates.. 1) careful evaluation of the patient and  \par
treatment of any pre-existing or co-existing disease, 2) proper control \par
of electrolytes, 3) avoidance of infection, 4) prompt correction of any \par
postoperative hypotension, 5) postoperative pulmonary ventilation and   \par
tracheal cleansing, and 6) avoidance of prolonged surgical procedures . \par
  a group of 26 patients past the age of 80 years underwent amputation  \par
of a lower extremity, without undue mortality (9 deaths) .              \par
  lumbar sympathectomy is not considered advisable in these aged pa-    \par

cancer-bearing tissue explants from all cases and noncancerbearing lung \par

observation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-  \par
tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of the  \par
dead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship of   \par
ameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in a          \par
juxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerous   \par
lymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboid           \par
lymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that this     \par
phenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibility \par

injection of tritiated thymidine, but thereafter the number of labeled  \par
lym phocytes rapidly increased to high maximum levels at 3 days .       \par
analysis of the labeling curves and grain counts indicates that the     \par
population of marrow lymphocytes is maintained in a dynamic steady state\par
with an average turnover time of 3 days or less .                       \par
  suspensions of bone marrow cells were isolated from the circulation   \par
within intraperitoneal diffusion chambers after short-term labeling with\par
tritiated thymidine in vivo . although very few small lymphocytes were  \par
labeled when introduced into the diffusion chambers, a considerable     \par

  tritiated thymidine was also administered intravenously whilst        \par
excluded from one hind limb by the application of an occlusive          \par
compression bandage for 20 minutes . very few labeled small lymphocytes \par
were found after 72 hours in the tibial marrow of the initially occluded\par
limb, whereas the normal high percentage was labeled in the control     \par
tibial marrow .                                                         \par
  these experiments do not demonstrate any large-scale influx of small  \par

result of the division of locally situated precursor cells, but the     \par

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelial\par
system of rabbits\par
tissues were removed from rabbits 4\par
and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,\par
25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants of\par
tissues from normal and injected animals\par
were grown in a coagulated plasma medium\par
and in medium containing 1 ug/ml of\par
endotoxin.  the migration and growth of cells\par
were observed during the following week\par
of incubation.  the inhibition or stimulation\par
of cells of the reticuloendothelial system\par
(res) at different host sites after endotoxin\par
administration depended on the dosage\par
and on the known capacity of different organs\par
to take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-\par
phage migration was suppressed in cultures\par
of spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose of\par
hibited by 200 ug, but macrophages in\par
lymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-\par
crease in numbers, in extent of migration\par
and in phagocytic activity.  widespread\par
res stimulation was seen in tissues removed\par
24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-\par
dition to the restoration of re cell activity in\par
spleen and lung there was a marked\par
increase in the migration of large phagocytic\par
cells from bone marrow, as well as\par
other organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injected\par
animals were as sensitive as\par
normal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.\par

assay study\par
swiss white mice between 2 and 4 days of age\par
developed generalized vaccinia viral\par
infection 2 to 7 days after intranasal inoculation.\par
gross and histologic evidence of\par
pneumonia was seen in more than 80% of\par
approximately 300 mice.  virus was re-\par
covered in relatively high titers from the\par
lungs (10   pfu per g) during the per-\par
iod when pneumonia developed; viremia\par
was also present, but virus titers in the\par
blood stream remained much below those\par
in the lungs.  histologically, vaccinia\par
pneumonia was characterized by large swollen\par
mononuclear cells giving rise to\par
marked widening of alveolar septa.  only\par
scattered neutrophils were noted, usually\par
in association with cell necrosis.  exudation\par
of edema fluid and red cells into al-\par
veoli was considered the result of viral\par
replication and cytopathic effect on cells\par
comprising alveolar septa.  various forms\par
of vaccinia virus were observed by elec-\par
tron microscopy within both 'type i' and\par
'type ii' alveolar lining cells, capillary\par
endothelial cells, and interstitial cells\par
within alveolar walls.  these infected inter-\par
stitial cells were probably derived from\par
fixed macrophages and were noted also\par
around bronchioles.  virus particles were\par
similarly observed in bronchiolar epi-\par
thelium and surrounding smooth muscle\par
cells.  the earliest pathologic ultrastruc-\par
tural change noted in virus infected cells\par
was intracellular edema, evidenced by\par
low electron density of the background\par
cytoplasmic material and dilatation of the\par
endoplasmic reticulum.  more extensive\par
changes resulted in cell necrosis with\par
release of virus particles into the extracellular space.\par

the shape and dimensions of these lattice and\par
lamellar structures were similar to\par

alveolar epithelial edema and cyto-\par
lysis, endothelial 'thinning' and cytolysis,\par
excessive elastic and collagenous alveo-\par
lar wall fibrosis, hyperplasia of alveolar\par
wall smooth muscle, numerous intra-\par
alveolar lattice and lamellar bodies, hyaline\par
membrane formation, hypertrophied\par
endothelial perikaryons, numerous alveolar\par
macrophages, and alveolar epithelial\par

1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilic\par
inclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentally\par
produced respiratory distress\par
the lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambs\par
were studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodies\par
first appeared at about 121 days gestation\par
and their total number increased with\par
maturation.  normal surface activity of\par
lung extracts was detectable a few days\par
following the appearance of inclusion\par
bodies.  the excretory nature of the type ii\par
alveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipid\par
nature of the inclusion body content, the\par
decrease in the number of inclusion\par
bodies and their loss of density associated\par
with respiratory distress and with the\par
loss of normal surface activity of lung ex-\par
tracts provide strong evidence that\par
inclusion bodies are the source of pulmonary\par
surfactant.  a dense osmiophilic alveolar\par
lining layer in mammals is described.\par
since the presence of such a layer is\par
well correlated with surface tension values\par
and the number of inclusions, it is\par
suggested that this layer consists of surface\par
active substances.  the difficulty in\par
detecting such an osmiophilic layer in other\par
mammals is thought to be, at least\par
in part, due to species differences in the compo-\par
sition of materials constituting the\par
pulmonary surfactant.  cytologic immaturity\par
exists until lamb fetuses reach 135\par
days gestation.  this is considered to be the\par
basis for the susceptibility of immature\par
lambs to respiratory distress.  fibrin with\par
230 a periodicity is a component,\par
although a small one, of hyaline membranes in\par
lambs.  in view of the fact that mature\par
fibrin appearing as bundles of fibrils is rare-\par
ly found, it is suggested that the bulk\par
of the hyaline membrane is not a mature fi-\par
brin, but probably consists of polymers\par
of fibrinogen and serum protein.\par

3831. lysosomes in the rat sciatic nerve following crush\par
peripheral nerves undergoing degeneration\par
are favorable material for studying the\par
types, origins, and functions of lysosomes.\par
the following lysosomes are described\par
(a) autophagic vacuoles in altered schwann\par
cells.  within these vacuoles the myelin\par
and much of the axoplasm which it encloses\par
in the normal nerve are degraded (wal-\par
lerian degeneration).  the delimiting\par
membranes of the vacuoles apparently form\par
from myelin lamellae.  considered as\par
possible sources of their acid phosphatase are\par
golgi vesicles (primary lysosomes), lysosomes\par
of the dense body type, and the endo-\par
plasmic reticulum which lies close to the vacuoles.\par
(b) mebranous bodies that accu-\par
mulate focally in myelinated fibers in a zone extending\par
2 to 3 mm distal to the crush.\par
these appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum\par
in which demonstrable acid\par
phosphatase activity increases markedly within 2 hours\par
after the nerve is crushed.\par
(c) autophagic vacuoles in the axoplasm of fibers\par
proximal to the crush.  the break-\par
down of organelles within these vacuoles may have\par
significance for the reorganization\par
of the axoplasm preparatory to regeneration.\par
(d) phagocytic vacuoles of altered\par
schwann cells.  as myelin degeneration begins, some\par
axoplasm is exposed.  this\par
is apparently engulfed by the filopodia of the schwann\par
cells, and degraded within the\par
phagocytic vacuoles thus formed.  (e) multivesicular\par
bodies in the axoplasm of myelina-\par
ted fibers.  these are generally seen near the nodes of ranvier.\par

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distress\par
syndrome\par
maturation and pathologic alterations of the lung\par
in 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratory\par
distress syndrome were studied by light-and electron\par
microscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-\par
borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathic\par
respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-\par
les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologic\par
pattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantly\par
lined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelial\par
component of most blood-air barriers.  well expanded\par
alveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsed\par
alveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-\par
ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-air\par
barriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-\par
clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyond\par
the 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies and\par
presumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occur\par
but only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-\par
ever, this process was not accompanied by reduction\par
in the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-\par
mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-\par
pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to be\par
determined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.\par
structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-\par
mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-\par
tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intact\par
epithelial lining and marked septal edema but were free\par
of hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-\par
gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-\par
ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelial\par
damage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.\par
they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-\par
bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-\par
tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.\par

903. lattice structures and osmiophilic bodies in the developing\par
respiratory tissue of rats\par
osmiophilic inclusions have been observed in the\par
lungs of rats particularly in the 20-day rat embryo and\par
newborn up to 3 days post partum.  these inclusions\par
are present in the large alveolar cells as dense lamin-\par
ated structures of variable size and configuration.  they\par
generally consist of concentrically arranged membranes\par
and have the appearance of myelin figures, usually with\par
a dense center.  these osmiophilic inclusions are fre-\par
quently seen in direct contact with the cell membranes\par
and the alveolar space.  the alveolar space contains\par
numerous osmiophilic myelin figures which are thought\par
to originate from the intracellular osmiophilic inclu-\par
sions.  they may extrude through a channel formed in-\par
side the cell or by rupture of the cell membrane.  secre-\par
tion materials may occasionally be seen in the cyto-\par
plasm of the large alveolar epithelial cells.  these cells\par
appear to be in the process of degeneration.  their cell\par
surfaces are disrupted and the cytoplasm is continuous\par
with materials in the air space.  the lattice structure\par
in the alveolar space may originate from the cytoplas-\par
mic secretion material.  the cytoplasmic secretion ma-\par
terial in the cell and the lattice structures in the air\par
space disappear after the rats are 3 days old.  (i,t*)\par

a case of a 3-month-old infant with intense pro-\par

second similar case in a 9-month-old infant with gener-\par
alized glycogen storage disease and a case of a 51-year-\par
old male with bilateral xanthogranuloma of choroid\par
plexus and proliferation of the choroidal epithelial cells\par
are discussed.  the pathogenesis of the foamy xanthoma\par
cells in the stroma of the choroid plexus, particularly,\par
is discussed.  the authors believe that the origin of foamy\par
cells and the mode of formation of such a xanthogranuloma\par
can be explained by the proliferative capability and the\par
phagocytic activity of the choroid epithelium.  choroidal\par
epithelial cells can be regarded as fixed macrophages\par
which becomes wandering phagocytes after detachment.\par
disintegration of these foamy cells then releases the\par
lipid content into the interstitium and provokes a re-\par
sponse of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells\par
of the foreign-body type.  hemorrhage is also considered\par
as a factor involved in the formation of xanthogranuloma.\par

the origin of alveolar macrophages was investiga-\par

mosome analysis it was found that in both normal lungs\par
and in lungs exposed to an irritant, approximately two-\par
thirds of the dividing cells which could be recovered by\par
lung washing arose from the hematopoietic system and\par
one-third were of pulmonary origin.\par

632. pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  a study using enzyme histochemistry,\par
electron microscopy, and surface tension measurement\par
lung biopsies from 4 patients with pulmonary al-\par
veolar proteinosis were studied using histochemical me-\par
thods, electron microscopy, and surface tension mea-\par
surement.  the lipid-rich intraalveolar fluid contained\par
material with the staining reactions and ultrastructure\par
of phospholipid.  although many alveoli were lined by\par
enzymatically active, secreting granular pneumonocy-\par
tes, extracts of proteinotic tissue were not surface\par
active, and, in fact, inhibited normal surfactant.  some\par
of the cells free in the intraalveolar material were de-\par
generating sloughed granular pneumonocytes.  at the\par
margins of the lesions were lipid-filled macrophages\par
which appear to play a role in the removal of the mate-\par
rial.  these observations indicate that alveolar protein-\par
osis is not a primary overproduction of surfactant and\par
are consistent with the concept that the alveolar clear-\par
ing process is defective in this disease.\par

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and disease\par
in summary, the authors have attempted\par
to bring together the multiple observations\par
which seem germane to the understanding\par
of surface phenomena in lungs in health\par
and disease.  to this end, the contributions\par
of anatomists and pathologists on the\par
fine structure of alveolar cells and their\par
lining are fundamental.  the concepts of\par
alveolar stability required the special\par
insights of physiologists who were concerned\par
with the causes of bubble stability as\par
they related to the particular problems posed\par
by a lung of several millions of bubbles\par
arranged in parallel.  soon the contributions\par
of the chemists became significant as\par
methods of identification and assay of the al-\par
veolar lining material were of interest.\par
clinicians asked what relevance these studies\par
had to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,\par
and soon the question of when the surfac-\par
tant appeared in development occurred to\par
those concerned with premature infants.\par
students of metabolism began to focus on\par
the lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,\par
and their tools seem most promising at\par
this time in unearthing possible errors in\par
metabolism which may express themselves\par
in disease.  surgeons who undertake per-\par
fusion of the isolated lung ask the\par
requirements of that organ with respect to the\par
nutrients and environment of the alveolar\par
cells, and anesthesiologists inquire into\par
the possibilities of mechanical injury\par
to the alveoli during artificial respiration.\par
the problems posed to the reviewers\par
of a subject which touches so many disciplines\par
are obvious.  doubtless some pertinent\par
studies have been omitted although uninten-\par
tionally; others may have been\par
misinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-\par
cialists in all specialties.  the\par
authors hope they have provided evidence that the\par
forces of surface tension cannot\par
be ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interface\par
of some 70 m2.  they further hope\par
they have described some of the properties of\par
the film at the alveolar-air interface\par
which operate to produce stability of the alveoli.\par
they hold the belief that study of the\par
metabolism of the alveolar lining layer will\par
further their understanding of a number\par
of disease processes in which it may be\par
altered.  and lastly, they hope for much\par
closer communication between workers in\par
many disciplines who can elucidate this\par
remarkable subject best through cooperative\par
studies.\par

posure to increased oxygen tension\par
the syndrome of progressive respiratory\par
distress, pulmonary edema, and increased\par
pulmonary surface tension was induced in\par
8 dogs by exposure to oxygen tensions\par
greater than 550 mm hg for 44.5 and 52\par
hours.  pulmonary surfactant was extracted\par
by endobronchial washing for measurement\par
of lipid composition and surface activity.\par
five dogs developed respiratory distress\par
without pulmonary edema.  in these dogs\par
endobronchial wash surface tension was\par
normal or slightly increased, and total\par
lipid distribution was essentially normal.\par
esterified fatty acids in the lecithin frac-\par
tion were consistently altered with a\par
reduction in palmitate and total saturated fatty\par
acids.  three dogs developed pulmonary\par
edema with increased surface tension, in-\par
creased total lipid and protein, and\par
relatively decreased total phospholipid in the\par
endobronchial washings.  esterified\par
fatty acids in the lecithin fraction were marked-\par
ly altered with palmitate levels about\par
1/3 normal.  esterified arachidonate was pre-\par
sent that was attributed to intra-alveolar\par
plasma.  electron micrographs of the lung\par

measurement of cerebral oxygen tension\par
in man has been hampered by technical dif-\par

in which a beckman microelectrode was\par
introduced into the cisterna magna and\par
oxygen tension measured, the hypothesis\par
being that measurement of oxygen tension\par
in a fluid which equilibrates with the\par
average cerebral oxygen tension should\par
give reliable measure of cerebral oxygen\par
tension.  in their subjects, inhalation of\par
pure oxygen produced an increase in the\par
oxygen tension in the cisternal fluid as\par
well as in the arterial blood without any\par
alteration of the oxygen tension in the\par
bulb of the internal jugular vein, whereas\par
inhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon\par
dioxide increased the oxygen tension in the\par
cisternal fluid as well as in the arterial\par
and venous blood.  5% carbon dioxide in\par
air produced an increase in the cisternal\par
oxygen tension; a fall in arterial blood\par
pressure associated with the introduction\par
of the suboccipital needle was accom-\par
panied by a decrease in cisternal oxygen\par
tension which then rose simultaneously with\par
the increase in arterial blood pressure\par
that followed infusion of dextran.  intravenous\par
injection of xanthinol niacinate induced\par
in all patients a more or less pronounced fall\par
in arterial blood pressure and at the\par
same time the cisternal oxygen tension fell;\par
administration of aramine was associated\par
with a rise in arterial blood pressure\par
plus a rise in cisternal oxygen tension.\par

hematocrit 49, sao, 89.6.  in 6 subjects at\par
4,545 m and 4 at 4,820 m csf values\par
were not significantly different; mean arterial\par
pco, was 32.6 and 32.3, respectively.\par
the only significant variations with altitude\par
were the expected lowering of pao, to\par
47 and 43.5 mm hg, and of sao, to 84.2 and\par
80.7, and increase of hematocrit to\par
67% and 75%, respectively.  the natives\par
differed from recently acclimatized sea-\par
level residents in showing less ventilation\par
(higher pco,) in response to the ex-\par
isting hypoxia, and less alkaline arterial\par
blood.  the difference appears to relate\par
to peripheral chemoreceptor response\par
to hypoxia rather than central medullary\par
chemoreceptor.\par

in 7 cats the concentrations of na,\par
k, ca, mg, and cl were measured in plasma\par
ultrafiltrate, newly formed choroid\par
plexus fluid, and cisterna magna fluid.  the\par
choroid plexus fluid did not differ\par
from plasma ultrafiltrate in cl and k concentra-\par
tion but contained higher na, markedly\par
higher mg, and lower ca concentrations\par
than the ultrafiltrate.  cisterna magna\par
fluid differed from the ultrafiltrate with\par
respect to all 5 electrolytes, containing\par
higher concentrations of cl, na, and mg\par
and lower concentrations of k and\par
ca.  it differed from choroid plexus fluid in con-\par
taining a higher concentration of cl but\par
lower concentrations of k, ca, and\par
mg.  hco3-concentration, calculated on the\par
basis of the charge balance, was 7 mm/kg\par
h2o higher in choroid plexus fluid than\par
in cisterna magna fluid, suggesting an ele-\par
vated ph at the former site.  without\par
measurement of the potential difference be-\par
tween the csf and plasma, definitive\par
conclusions could not be drawn as to which\par
cations were actively transported.  the fact\par
that the distribution ratio between cerebro-\par
spinal fluid and ultrafiltrate of one divalent\par
cation was in the opposite direction\par
from that of the other, and that this was\par
also true of the monovalent cations, was\par
taken as evidence that the mechanisms\par
involved in cation transfer are quite selec-\par
tive.  though not proven, active transport\par
was considered the most likely explana-\par
tion of these findings.  the data suggest\par
that these specific transfer mechanisms\par
subserve a homeostatic function with\par
regard to mg and k in the cerebrospinal fluid.\par

oxygen availability in man.  during the inter-\par
val of tolerated breath-holding for\par
69 seconds or less, jugular venous oxygen tension\par
was increased owing to increased\par
cerebral blood flow resulting from an increase\par
of arterial carbon dioxide tension.\par
there was a statistically significant correlation\par
between changes in jpo2 and paco2,\par
which proved to be more or less linear for\par
both increases and decreases of paco2 4\par
mm. above and below control levels.  no\par
threshold was found for changes in paco2\par
altering effective cerebral perfusion and\par
cerebral venous po2, extremely small\par
changes in paco2 (less than 1 mm. hg)\par
altered cerebral oxygen availability within\par
10 to 20 seconds.  during the valsalva\par
maneuver a consistent reduction of jugular\par
oxygen tension was found associated\par
with the sudden fall in arterial blood\par
pressure and reduction of arterial carbon\par

2344. respiratory and cardiovascular changes during rapid spon-\par
taneous variations of ventricular fluid pressure in pa-\par
tients with intracranial hypertension\par
in patients with intracranial hypertension\par
the ventricular fluid pressure (vfp)\par
curve is characterized by 3 main forms\par
of spontaneous variations.  two of these\par
forms are of a rhythmical nature, and\par
are here called 1-per-minute waves and 6-\par
per-minute waves, respectively, in\par
accordance with the dominating frequency.\par
the third form - irregularly appearing\par
waves of large amplitude and duration -\par
is called plateau waves in accordance\par
with the usual shape of the fluctuations.\par
respiratory and cardio-vascular changes\par
accompanying these variations of the vfp\par
were studied by simultaneous recording,\par
in various combinations, of the vfp, the\par
pulmonary ventilation, the pco2 of the\par
expiratory air, the arterial and the venous\par
blood pressure, and the pulse frequency.\par
it was found that the rhythmic vfp vari-\par
ations of the 1-per-minute type occurred\par
synchronously with the respiratory peri-\par
ods in cheyne-stokes breathing.\par
synchronously appearing variations in systemic\par
blood pressure, in pulse frequency,\par
as well as in consciousness and in muscular\par
tone of the limbs were also noted.  the\par
respiratory midposition shifted towards the\par
inspiratory side during the periods of\par
hyperpnoea.  the 6-per-minute waves were\par
entirely synchronous with variations\par
in the systemic arterial blood pressure of the\par
traube-hering-mayer type.  long\par
sequences of these waves were observed only\par
when the vfp level was considerably\par
elevated.  the plateau waves were not accom-\par
panied by corresponding elevations of\par
the arterial or venous systemic blood pres-\par
sure.  simultaneously with the crests\par
of the plateau waves sudden changes often\par
occurred in the pulse frequency (from\par
bradycardia to tachycardia), and in the res-\par
piratory pattern, sometimes also in the\par
degree of consciousness and in the muscu-\par
lar tone.  there were also long sequences\par
of 6-per-minute waves.  the deep, irre-\par
gular breathing seen in this stage induced\par
a considerable hypocapnia preceeding\par
the final critical fall in the vfp ending the\par
plateau wave.  in most instances, how-\par
ever, this fall did not begin until several\par
minutes after the appearance of the hypo-\par
capnia.\par

exposed to oxygen at high pressure\par
adult female rats paralyzed by repeated exposures\par
to oxygen at high pressure were found to have cns le-\par
sions of 2 types  (1) focal necrosis of individual neurons\par
within certain nuclear groups, and (2) complete or partial\par
necrosis of nuclear groups with frequent damage to mye-\par
lin, axons, and glia in the area involved.  both types\par
were usually bilateral and symmetrical.  lesions of the\par
first type were found consistently in the superior olivary\par
complex, ventral cochlear nuclei, and nuclei of the spinal\par
tract of cranial nerve v.  lesions of the second type were\par
found consistently in the substantia nigra and globus pal-\par
lidus, were frequent in the rhinencephalon, and never\par
occurred in the neocortex.\par

747. electrode size and tissue po2 measurement in rats exposed\par
to air or high pressure oxygen\par
a comparison has been made of values of\par
po2 recorded in several rat tissues with\par
60-u or 330-u flexible gold electrodes.\par
although qualitatively both sizes of elec-\par
trodes give similar results, the quantitative\par
values of po2 differ.  such large differ-\par
ences as are found in some cases between\par
electrodes varying only in physical di-\par
mensions are thought to reflect the amount\par
of trauma caused in the tissue under in-\par
vestigation due to electrode insertion.\par
errors in po2 estimations due to tissue da-\par
mage are considered to outweigh any other\par
errors such as those due to electrode\par
calibration.  soft, highly vascular tissues,\par
such as liver, kidney and spleen, which\par
show macroscopic bruising over quite a\par
large area when electrodes are inserted,\par
show the greatest difference in estimations\par
of the po2 value.  recordings of tissue\par
po2 were made while animals breathed air\par
and when compressed to 4 or 5 atm. in\par
pure oxygen, and the pattern of response of\par
tissue po2 to such exposure of the ani-\par
mal to high pressures of oxygen is described.\par

3384. adrenergic effects in splenic po2 of rats in air or oxygen\par
at 5 atmospheres\par
oxygen tensions have been measured\par
in the spleens of rats breathing air and during\par
exposure of the animals to 5 atm abs\par
of oxygen (hpo).  the response of splenic po2\par
to compression was complex, usually\par
reaching a peak value immediately after com-\par
pression, then falling to a lower value.\par
this form of response has been termed a\par
hump response.  after adrenalectomy\par
or bretylium tosylate injection the hump res-\par
ponse of po2 after compression was\par
almost abolished, and the values of splenic po2\par
at 5 atm were considerably higher\par
than in control animals.  a combination of adrena-\par
lectomy and bretylium tosylate also\par
markedly reduced the number of hump responses,\par
but unexpectedly significantly lowered\par
splenic oxygen tensions, both when the ani-\par
mals were under ambient conditions\par
or at 5 atm of oxygen.  cardiac rate and blood\par
pressure were studied in an attempt\par
to find the explanation of this latter effect, and\par
while blood pressure was the same\par
in adrenalectomized rats and control rats after\par
bretylium injection, adrenalectomy\par
potentiated the bradycardia produced by brety-\par
lium tosylate.\par

the tests used were preconclusive pe-\par
riod and survival time of mice at 5 atm\par
absolute oxygen, lung damage in rats ex-\par
posed to 5 atm oxygen for 1 hr., and post\par
ohp paralysis in rats following deep\par
pentobarbital-na anesthesia and ohp at 4\par
atm for 30 min.  2,5-bis (1,1-dimethyl-\par
propyl) hydroquinone gave excellent\par
protection against ohp toxicity in all tests,\par
and several other antioxidants also\par
protected against ohp toxicity but their potency\par
and effectiveness varied for the\par

3716. glycolytic control mechanisms. i. inhibition of glycolysis\par
by acetate and pyruvate in the isolated, perfused rat heart\par
acetate or pyruvate had similar effects\par
on the over-all metabolism of glucose.  gly-\par
colytic flux was decreased in both the\par
presence and absence of insulin, glucose\par
oxidation was greatly decreased, and\par
the conversion of glucose to glycogen and lac-\par
tate was promoted.  glucose phosphorylation\par
was decreased in the presence but not\par
in the absence of insulin.  hexokinase,\par
phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phos-\par
phate dehydrogenase, and pyruvic kinase\par
are far displaced from equilibrium, while\par
the other enzymic steps of glycolysis\par
are maintained either at equilibrium or fairly\par
close to equilibrium.  in different metabolic\par
situations, glycolytic flux may be affec-\par
ted by those steps which are far displaced\par
from equilibrium.  increased levels of\par
the hexose monophosphates, and decreased\par
levels of the other glycolytic inter-\par
mediates between fructose 1,6-diphosphate\par
and pyruvate after the addition of 10 mm\par
acetate indicate that glycolytic flux was\par
decreased by inhibition of phosphofructo-\par
kinase.  after the addition of 10 mm pyruvate,\par
fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and triose-\par
phosphate accumulated as a result of an\par
inhibition of either glyceraldehyde phosphate\par
dehydrogenase or phosphoglyceric kinase.\par
acetate had little effect on the total con-\par
tent of oxidized or reduced di- or\par
triphosphopyridine nucleotides, but slightly de-\par
creased the ratio of nad to nadh2\par
in the cytoplasm, as estimated from the ratios\par
of lactate to pyruvate and a-glycerophosphate\par
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  pyru-\par
vate increased the total content of nadh2\par
and nadph2 as shown both by an increase\par
of fluorescence in the intact heart, and by\par
tissue analyses, but the ratio of nad to\par
nadii2 in the cytoplasm was greatly\par
increased.  these results demonstrate com-\par
partmentation of pyridine nucleotides\par
between cytoplasm and mitochondria in the\par
intact cell.  after the addition of acetate,\par
citrate was the only intermediate of the\par
citric acid cycle which increased greatly\par
in amount, while oxaloacetate levels de-\par
creased.  after the addition of pyruvate,\par
the levels of citrate, a-ketoglutarate, ma-\par
late, and oxaloacetate were all greatly\par
elevated.  the glutamic-oxaloacetate trans-\par
aminase reaction as measured from the\par
total contents of the reactants in the tissue\par
remained close to equilibrium.  changes\par
in the concentrations of the adenine nu-\par
cleotides were insufficient to account for\par
the inhibition of phosphofructokinase, but\par
the results are consistent with control at this\par
step being mediated by citrate.\par

oxygen tensions were recorded continuously\par

absolute.  mean rises to 620\par
mm. hg and 320 mm. hg for tumours and normal tissues\par
respectively were recorded.\par

pressure 22/90 (24%) of tumour elec-\par
trodes registered po2values of less than 4 mm. hg\par
compared to only 2/39 (5%) of normal\par

suggest that oxygen polarography as a meth-\par
od for determining po2 in 'solid' tissues\par
in vivo is complicated by many artefacts -\par
particularly tissue damage due to electrode\par
trauma - which reduce its value to clin-\par

7839.cortical ph and the blood-brain barrier\par
a method was described for measuring\par
the ph, dc and ac potentials concurrently\par
on the cerebral cortex of the adult cat,\par
under conditions of controlled ventilation.\par
kittens and rabbits were also studied.\par
the cortical ph response to i.v. nahco3\par
was acidic and was accompanied by a\par
dc negativity, while the blood became alkaline.\par
such an acidic response was present in\par
the rabbit and kitten.  it was not present\par
in a number of other tissues in the cat,\par
including the dura.  the cortical acidic\par
response was not affected, qualitatively,\par
by i.v. acetazolamide, prolonged hypoxia\par
or 10% (v/v) co2.  it was reduced reversibly\par
by 20% (v/v) co2.  it was not affected\par
by removal of the arachnoid membrane.\par
the cortical ph response to an i.v. nh4+\par
salt solution was complex.  nh4c1 did not\par
produce an alkaline response.  the cortical\par
ph response to an alkaline or an acidic\par
sodium phosphate solution was augmented\par
but not changed in its direction following\par
treatment of the cortex with n-butanol.\par
the results were interpreted in terms of\par
a restriction of hco3- by the blood-brain\par
barrier, through which co2 can pass.  this\par
restriction is probably non-specific for\par
inorganic ions, and perhaps for other\par
substances.  it does not appear to be related\par
to a low cerebral extracellular space,\par
and is independent of substantial oxidative metabolism.\par

pharmacological and biochemical observations\par
single exposures of high pressure oxygen\par

cns damage and paralysis in rats and mice\par
but guinea-pigs, rabbits, and man did\par
not show such sequelae.  the cns damage\par
in rats was greatly increased by cns-de-\par
pressant drugs (pentobarbital, paraldehyde,\par
n2o and phencyclidine) given before ex-\par
posure to ohp.  the cns lesions were also\par
potentiated by raised respired pco2, by\par
acetazolamide and by nh4c1, whilst protection\par
was afforded by methaemoglobinae-\par
mia by tham, by 2 4-dinitrophenol and by\par
serotonin against the barbiturate and\par
co2 potentiation of ohp brain damage.\par
ohp-induced brain damage was not modified\par
by hypothermia (cp2), electroconvulsive\par
shock treatment during ohp, cerebral x-\par
irradiation, adrenalectomy or cortisone,\par
slow decompression rates, spinal block\par
with local anaesthetic, 'conditioning' of\par

oxygen consumption of slices from the liver\par

phragm was determined in rats aged 5, 10,\par

under hypoxic conditions (gas phase 10%\par

of liver slices and diaghragm is decreased\par
by about 25% in all age groups.  hypoxia,\par
however, did not affect oxygen consumption\par

started to rise.  the inhibitory effect of\par

5407. hypoxic-hypercapnic interaction in subjects with bilateral\par
cerebral dysfunction\par
to analyze cerebral influences modifying\par
autonomic respiratory responses, the\par
authors compared normals and patients\par
with bilateral pyramidal tract disease for\par
their ventilatory response to hypoxia and\par
hypoxia-hypercapnia.  during eucapnia,\par
the 2 groups showed similar hypoxic\par
responses.  during hypercapnia, the ventilatory\par
response to hypoxia was greater in the\par
brain-damaged subjects.  this apparent aug-\par
mentation, however, was due entirely\par
to anoxia interacting with an abnormally fa-\par
cilitated carbon dioxide sensitivity\par
compared with normals, brain-damaged patients\par
at pao,90-100 mm hg showed an 85%\par
greater co2 response, and at pao,50mm hg\par
showed a 79% greater co2 response.\par
since cerebral dysfunction facilitated the ven-\par
tilatory response to hypoxia-hypercapnia\par
combined but not the response to hypoxia\par
alone, the results imply that the 2\par
respiratory stimuli interact centrally rather than\par
peripherally.\par

three times the cord level after birth\par

and the infant ffa level; there was,\par
however, a significant negative correlation\par
between the length of maternal fasting\par
prior to delivery and the infant blood sugar\par
level at 24 hours of age.  high ffa levels\par

in serum total fatty acids was related\par
to the dietary intake of linoleate in 243 infants\par
two to four months of age and in 197\par
infants eleven to twelve months of age.  the\par
curves relating triene tetraene ratio\par
to dietary linoleate indicated approximately\par
1 per cent of total calories as minimal\par
linoleate requirement.  the exponential\par
equations relating dienoic, trienoic and\par
tetraenoic acids to dietary linoleate were\par
derived by computer methods.  these\par
yielded constants from which the minimal\par
nutrient requirement could be calculated.\par
the best estimates were obtained from the\par
triene and tetraene data for two to four\par
months' old infants and were found to be\par
approximately 1.4 per cent of the caloric\par
intake.  the nutritive status with respect to\par
linoleate may be estimated by means\par
of logarithmic regression equations.  the\par
equation for two to four months' old infants\par
is  log 10 dietary linoleate = -1.087 + 0.0432\par
(di - tri + tetra).  the data for eleven to\par
twelve months' old infants were found to have\par
greater scatter and give lower triene\par
tetraene ratios at comparable linoleate intakes.\par
the scatter and displacement are\par
considered to be due to supplements of solid food\par
to the basic diet not considered in\par
the calculated dietary linoleate.\par

in addition to marked reductions in\par

2579. measurement of aortic regurgitation by upstream sampling with continuous\par
infusion of indicator\par
a direct and theoretically valid method\par
for the measurement of aortic regurgitation\par
involves the recording of indicator concentrations\par
from the left ventricle and a down-\par
stream site during aortic root injection.  however,\par
this method has yielded erratic\par
results when applied to man in the authors'\par
laboratory when using the sudden in-\par
jection technique.  therefore, the upstream\par
sampling method, using continuous in-\par
fusion of indicator, was evaluated in 18 patients\par
with aortic regurgitation during\par
retrograde aortic and transseptal left ventricular\par
catheterization.  the continuous\par
infusion technique was compared with the technique\par
of sudden injection in 10 patients\par
and with aortic valvulography in 14 patients.\par
measurements of forward flow obtained\par
with continuous infusions into the aortic root\par
were not significantly different from\par
measurements obtained with sudden injections\par
into the pulmonary artery.  recordings\par
of indicator concentrations from the left ventricle,\par
during continuous infusions into\par
the aortic root, demonstrated readily evident\par
equilibrium plateaus.  the resultant\par
measurements of regurgitant flow were highly\par
reproducible and not impaired by\par
nonsimultaneity of upstream and downstream\par
sampling.  the percentage error of\par
estimate at 95% confidence limits was 22% of\par
the measurement for regurgitant flow,\par
13% for total flow, and 9% for the regurgitant\par
fraction of total flow.  the correspond-\par
ing errors of estimate for the sudden injection\par
technique were 4 times larger.  re-\par
gurgitant flow by the continuous infusion method\par
ranged from 0.8-30.0 l/min, total\par
flow from 3.0-36.0 l/min, and the regurgitant\par
fraction of total flow from 12-86%.\par
ranking of patients by the magnitudes of regurgitant\par
and total flow did not correspond\par
to ranking by angiographic criteria of severity.\par
however, an excellent correlation\par
prevailed between angiographic grade and the regurgitant\par
fraction of total flow,\par
demonstrating that this variable is the most meaningful\par
expression of severity.  the\par
correlation (0.997) between the angiographic grade and\par
the regurgitant fraction\par
measured by the continuous infusion technique was\par
clearly superior to that obtained\par
with the sudden injection technique (0.894).  mild\par
regurgitation was equivalent to\par
a regurgitant fraction of <25%, moderate\par
regurgitation to a fraction of 25-50%,\par
moderately severe regurgitation to a fraction\par
of 50-75% and severe regurgitation to\par
a fraction of >75%.  it is concluded that the\par
upstream sampling method during con-\par
tinuous infusion of indicator, because of its\par
sensitivity, reliability, applicability to\par
multiple measurements, and validity in the\par
presence of mitral regurgitation is the\par
most useful method for quantifying aortic\par
regurgitation in man.\par

to right ventricular outflow.  the presence\par
of associated cardiovascular anomalies,\par
in this and previously reported cases,\par
suggests that the malformation is congenital\par
rather than acquired.  the clinical and\par
hemodynamic manifestations of aortico-left\par
ventricular tunnel are indistinguishable\par
from those observed with the more common\par
forms of aortic regurgitation, and the\par
correct diagnosis can be established only by\par
thoracic aortography.  the malformation\par
is usually recognized in childhood; since\par
aortic regurgitant flow can be abolished by\par
simple closure of the aortic ostium,\par
and without aortic valve replacement, the\par
indications for operative treatment\par
differ from those which apply in aortic\par
regurgitation due to a valvular anomaly.\par

502. the haemodynamic implications of the bisferiens pulse\par
a bisferiens carotid arterial displacement pulse\par
was recorded in 10 patients with\par
severe aortic valvular disease.  the braunwald\par
test indicated that moderately severe,\par
severe, or gross aortic regurgitation was present\par
in each.  the absence of a peak\par
systolic aortic pressure gradient in certain cases,\par
particularly in those with the\par
most severe regurgitation, suggested their freedom\par
from an element of stenosis.\par
the anacrotic wave and the peak of the aortic\par
pressure pulse were found to coincide\par
with the percussion and the tidal waves of the\par
simultaneously recorded carotid ar-\par
terial displacement curves.  it is suggested that\par
amplitude of the peak of the anacro-\par
tic wave is proportional to the rate of change of\par
momentum of the ejected blood, and\par
that the amplitude of the corresponding percussion\par
wave of displacement is modified by\par
the distensibility of the artery.  the depth and shape\par
of the trough between the two\par
peaks is thought to depend upon the magnitude and\par
slope of the two waves rather than\par
upon a venturi effect.  it is suggested that the condition\par
of the arterial wall, the dia-\par
stolic blood pressure, and the stroke volume can\par
influence the pulse sufficiently to\par
preclude its use as a simple guide to the nature of\par
the aortic valve lesion.\par

2753. left ventricular function following replacement of the\par
aortic valve.  hemodynamic responses to muscular exercise\par
evaluations of left ventricular myocardial\par
function were carried out in 14 patients\par
4-16 mth after stenotic or regurgitant\par
malformations of the aortic valve had been\par
corrected by valve replacement.  the\par
circulatory responses to exercise, judged by\par
the increases in cardiac output in relation\par
to the increases in oxygen consumption,\par
were normal or only mildly reduced in 12\par
patients.  in 5 patients the relationships\par
between the change in the left ventricular\par
end-diastolic pressure and the alteration\par
in the stroke volume were also normal, a\par
fall or an increase in left ventricular\par
end-diastolic pressure of less than 3 mm\par
hg being accompanied by an increase in\par
stroke volume.  in 8 patients, however,\par
abnormal increases in the left ventricular\par
end-diastolic pressure occurred during\par
exercise, and in 4 the left ventricular end-\par
diastolic pressure was increased to levels\par
above 12 mm hg.  variable alterations in\par
the stroke volume accompanied these increases\par
in end-diastolic pressure.  it is\par
suggested that in the 3 patients who exhibited\par
simultaneous increases in left ven-\par
tricular end-diastolic pressure and stroke\par
volume, the changes were either a mani-\par
festation of the frank-starling mechanism,\par
or primarily the result of a positive\par
inotropic influence.  in the 5 patients who\par
exhibited increases in left ventricular\par
end-diastolic pressure, but no change or a\par
fall in stroke volume, it is proposed\par
that a distinct depression of left ventricular\par
performance was present.  thus, while\par
the cardiac output response was adequate to\par
meet the stress of exercise in the\par
majority of the patients studied following aortic\par
valve replacement, determination\par
of the relationship between the left ventricular\par
end-diastolic pressure and the stroke\par
volume permitted the detection of abnormalities\par
in the function of the left ventricle.\par

2497. pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum\par
when the pulmonary valve is atretic and\par
the ventricular septum intact, the right\par
ventricle usually consists of a small chamber\par
with a very thick wall capable of de-\par
veloping high pressure.  this pathologic picture\par
is associated with clinical findings\par
similar to those in tricuspid atresia-cyanosis,\par
decreased pulmonary flow, left ven-\par
tricular preponderance on the electrocardiogram,\par
and early death.  the diagnosis\par
may be confirmed by heart catheterization and\par
selective angiocardiography with in-\par
jection into the right ventricle, but the risk is\par
great.  surgery has never been suc-\par
cessful in the past; but because of the equally\par
hopeless prognosis on medical treat-\par
ment, attempts should continue to be made.\par
anastomosis of the superior vena cava\par
to the right pulmonary artery appears to offer\par
hope of success in the future.\par

1635. intra-atrial pressure measurement and electrocardiography in the\par
detailed diagnosis of atrial septal defect\par
after discussing the possibilities and\par
limitations of different methods for identifying\par
the anatomical type of atrial septal\par
defect, the authors suggest a more useful new\par
method.  this consists in simultaneous\par
recording of both the pressure curve and\par
endocavitary electrocardiogram during\par
withdrawal of the catheter from the left into\par
the right atrium.  in the ostium primum\par
type, the septal foramen has no infe-\par
rior margin, and the point of the catheter\par
during retraction (unlike in the ostium\par
secundum type) rests on the intermediate\par
section of the atrioventricular septum.\par
the endocavitary electrocardiogram in the\par
zone of passage between the two atria\par
shows the typical pattern of the intermediate\par
section of the atrioventricular septum;\par
the pressure curve may show a pattern of the\par
atrial of intravalvular type.\par

two cases of ventriuclar cuptal aneurysm\par
are reported, one in the membranous and one\par
in the muscular portion.  the diagnosis was\par
made by selective left ventricular angiogra-\par
phy.  it is suggested that these cases represent\par
spontaneous closure of a ventricular septal\par
defect with weakness and aneurysmal formation\par
due to the high left ventricular pressure.\par
both are asymptomatic and hemodynamically\par
within normal limits.  surgical repair\par
of the aneurysms is not considered necessary.\par

1642. electrode catheters and the diagnosis of ebstein's anomaly\par
of the tricuspid valve\par
the successful surgical treatment of ebstein's\par
anomaly calls for accurate pre-ope-\par
rative assessment of the nature and severity of\par
the tricuspid valvular lesion.  the\par
increased risk of cardiac catheterization in this\par
condition has been matched by in-\par
creased experience of intracardiac techniques,\par
and provided the examination is in\par
skilled hands, patients with ebstein's anomaly\par
should be investigated in the same\par
way as those with any other serious congenital\par
heart lesion for whom surgery is con-\par
templated.  the diagnostic value of electrode\par
catheters is discussed, and the intra-\par
cardiac electrocardiographic features of ebstein's\par
anomaly are illustrated.  false\par
positive and false negative records are demonstrated\par
and the mechanism of their\par
production is explained.  it is concluded that, though\par
helpful, intracardiac electro-\par
cardiographic evidence should be regarded as confirmatory\par
rather than diagnostic.\par
records made with electrode catheters during cardiac\par
catheterization should be con-\par
sidered only along with the other clinical,\par
electrocardiographic, and radiological\par
features of the case, and should not be relied upon\par
as the definitive method in the\par

gross cyanosis\par

vena cava open-\par
ing into the arterial atrium and\par

into the aorta through a ventricular\par

1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.\par
medical and pathologic aspects\par
thirty-four patients with ventricular septal defect\par
and aortic regurgitation, repre-\par
senting less than 5% of the patients with ventricular\par
septal defect, are discussed.\par
a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricular\par
septal defect, is noted dur-\par
ing infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation\par
(protodiastolic murmur and\par
wide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until some\par
time between 2 and 10\par
years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicate\par
that the principal hemody-\par
namic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas the\par
ventricular septal defect does not\par
usually result in a large pulmonary blood flow or\par
high pulmonary arterial pressure.\par
in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressure\par
gradient across the right ven-\par
tricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologic\par
studies indicate that the ventricular\par
septal defects are high and anterior and encroach\par
to a greater or lesser degree on\par
the membranous bulbar septum.  the right coronary\par
cusp is the one most severely\par
involved, and, by its prolapse, causes aortic\par
regurgitation; the noncoronary cusp\par
is always less severely affected.  the anatomic basis\par
of the pressure gradient ob-\par
served across the right ventricular outflow tract is\par
not always clear.\par

2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapir\par
the repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septal\par
defects between 1955 and 1961 was\par
reviewed to determine the incidence and prognosis\par
of arrhythmias related to operation.\par
cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61\par
atrial defects of the ostium secundum\par
type, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.\par
nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,\par
complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation that\par
persisted after completion of operation\par
were analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,\par
sinus tachycardia, and bundle branch\par
blocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of the\par
patients with ventricular defects, 17%\par
with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostium\par
secundum defects developed abnormal\par
rhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whose\par
arrhythmias began during operation,\par
there were 8 deaths; no fatalities occurred in the 24\par
patients who developed arrhythmias\par
in the postoperative period.  seven deaths were\par
associated with complete heart block and\par
one with second degree block.  although only one\par
half of the patients who developed\par
arrhythmias had pulmonary artery pressure greater\par
than 30 mm. hg systolic, all fatalities\par
occurred in this group.  four of the deaths followed\par
surgery with the use of the pump\par
oxygenator in children under 30 months of age.\par
thirty-eight per cent of the abnormal\par
rhythms that began in the postoperative period\par
were nodal.  flutter and fibrillation\par
were common following repair of atrial secundum\par
defects in patients over 15 yr. of age\par
but did not occur in younger patients.  deaths from\par
heart block occurred in the first 30 days\par
following operation except one, 5 months later.\par
survivors of complete heart block reverted\par
to a less serious arrhythmia or normal rhythm\par
within 3 months.\par

1021. left ventricular angiocardiography in the study of ventricular\par
septal defects\par
sixty-five cases of ventricular septal defect\par
were studied by left angiocardiography.\par
the left ventricle was entered by retrograde\par
arterial catheterization with a catheter\par
having a j-shaped tip.  this procedure appears\par
to be little, or no more, hazardous\par
than right-sided angiocardiography.  ventricular\par
septal defects may be divided into\par
5 types, depending on their location in the ventricular\par
septum.  the anatomic and\par
radiological features of the septum and septal defects\par
are described.  selective in-\par
jection of contrast material into the left ventricle\par
opacifies the blood passing through\par
the defect in the septum and permits preoperative\par
localization of the defect in rela-\par
tion to identifiable anatomic landmarks.  multiple\par
defects of the septum are well de-\par
monstrated.  such information may be of\par
considerable value to the surgeon under-\par
taking repair of the septum.  left ventriculography,\par
often combined with supraval-\par
vular aortography, has been used, when indicated,\par
to differentiate between mitral\par
insufficiency and ventricular septal defect and in\par
the detection of other cardiac ano-\par
malies whose manifestations are marked by those\par
of the septal lesion.  this tech-\par
nique is well suited to the postoperative study of\par
patients following repair of the\par
septal defect and for follow-up studies in patients\par
not operated upon to clarify the\par
natural history of defects in different portions of\par
the ventricular septum.\par

4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamsters\par
in normal chinese hamsters (cricetulus\par
griseus) the mean concentration of free\par
fatty acids (ffa) in serum varied from\par
group to group, but was (1) consistently 4\par
to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,\par
or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrian\par
hamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higher\par
than in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  the\par
epididymal adipose tissue of the chinese\par
hamster (1) had initial concentrations of\par
ffa comparable to those in the rat and\par
syrian hamster; (2) released, in the same\par
time interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffa\par
in vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) had\par
higher concentrations of ffa after incubation\par
than the incubated tissue of the rat.\par
the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissue\par
of the chinese hamster was less ac-\par
tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than the\par
epididymal, but was, however, more\par
active than the epididymal adipose tissue of\par
the rat.  these characteristics of ffa\par
metabolism in the chinese hamster were\par
apparently attributable to species, not to\par
age, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,\par
the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-\par
sue per gram of body was relatively high.\par
it appears that in this species the rate of\par
release of fatty acids from adipose tissue\par
is great, leading to high ffa concentra-\par
tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and rat\par
adipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-\par
sulin (separately) reduced the rate of release\par
of ffa and the amount of ffa in the\par
tissues, but glucose and insulin together\par
produced the greatest reduction.  the net\par
reduction in ffa release by glucose and\par
insulin in vitro was greater in tissue from\par
the chinese hamster.  insulin markedly\par
increased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-\par
sues of both species.  the possible relation\par
of the results to spontaneous diabetes in\par
the chinese hamster is discussed.\par

95. changes in serum non-esterified fatty acid levels in spon-\par
taneous and in oxytocin induced labour\par
the nonesterified fatty acid (nefa)\par
concentration of serum rises progressively\par
during the course of normal labor.\par
the rise appears to be related to the duration\par
of labor.  the use of oxytocin to induce\par
and stimulate labor does not alter the normal\par
pattern of rise in nefa provided it is\par
given in physiologic dosage.  the levels of\par
nefa in the umbilical vein and the\par
umbilical artery at delivery are comparable and\par
always significantly lower than the\par
maternal level.  the maternal/fetal ratio varies\par
between 1.7 1 and 3.9 1 in this series.\par
following delivery the nefa levels begin\par
to fall almost immediately.  the rate\par
of fall is 10-30% of the delivery value in the 1st\par
hour, 30-50% within 18 hr. and 50-70% within 36 hr.\par

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions on\par
the lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient\par
woman and of the fetus\par
the infusion of glucose with insulin during delivery\par
was used by the authors pri-\par
marily in order to determine, whether the utilization\par
of glucose can be enhanced\par
under these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,\par
whether the increase of unesteri-\par
fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes place\par
after a sole glucose infusion in\par
the mother, could be caused by the low capability\par
of glucose utilization in the fetus.\par
the infusion during delivery which consisted of the\par
application of 500 ml of 10%\par
glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30\par
min. brought about a greater decrease\par
of unesterified fatty acids in the parturient woman\par
as compared with the infusion of\par
glucose exclusively.  the reason for this result\par
is thought to be due to a better utili-\par
zation of glucose which is favorably influenced\par
by insulin.  during the infusion of\par
glucose with insulin, an increase in the values\par
of lactic and pyruvic acid took place\par
in the parturient women; this was probably due\par
to an accelerated glycolysis and an\par
increased production of lactic acid, but not\par
caused by a higher share of the anaerobic\par
metabolism.  in the cord blood, there were\par
likewise increased values of lactic and py-\par
ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher values\par
of these substances in the mother.  the\par
formation of these products of metabolic\par
breakdown by the fetus, however, was not\par
significantly increased.  after infusion of\par
glucose with insulin, the other investigated\par
parameter values, including those of the levels\par
of unesterified fatty acids are found\par
in the cord blood in similar amounts as after\par
infusion of glucose alone.  these re-\par
sults cannot reliably prove the passage of\par
insulin through the placenta especially\par
after a continued study of the metabolic values\par
in newborns.  as a proof of the passage\par
of insulin through the placenta could not be\par
established, it is possible that after an\par
intake of insulin the increase of unesterified\par
fatty acids in the cord blood could be\par
caused by a relative insufficiency of the insular\par
apparatus of the fetus.  the most\par
probable reason for the increase of unesterified\par
fatty acids is the different depo-\par
sition and metabolization of unesterified fatty\par
acids in the course of intrauterine\par
life.\par

of the mother and of the umbilical cord.\par
the concentration of both substances was\par
significantly higher in the mother than in\par
the infant.  the relation for free fatty acids\par

ii. plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acid, and epineph-\par
rine-norepinephrine alterations\par
seven controls and 9 preeclamptic patients\par
were infused with different amounts of\par
epinephrine.  plasma nefa, glucose and\par
catecholamines were determined before,\par
during and after epinephrine infusion.  the\par
toxemic patient responds to the metabolic\par
effects of infused epinephrine in a manner\par
similar to that of the normal pregnant\par
patient.  the increased levels of nefa in\par
pregnant patients are explained by a com-\par
plicated biochemical mechanism involving\par
an increased availability of cortisone-like\par
steroids, slightly increased amounts of thyroid,\par
hormones, etc., resulting in an\par
alteration of carbohydrate utilization.  the study\par
leads to the conclusion that epi-\par
nephrine is not an etiologic agent in toxemia of pregnancy.\par

766. a lipid-mobilizing substance in the serum of pregnant wo-\par
men, of probable placental origin\par
a substance capable of inducing free fatty\par
acid (ffa) release was found in the sera\par
of 12 from 13 pregnant women.  the rat\par
epididymal fat pad was used for bioassay.\par
this substance circulates in late pregnancy\par
and disappears within 5 days post partum.\par
it is present in crude placental extracts and\par
is removed by their deproteination.  it\par
is nondialyzable.  application of pituitary\par
extraction procedure to placentae yielded\par
active fractions where pituitary growth\par
hormone is usually found.  in accordance with\par
these facts a hypothesis concerning a part\par
of metabolic changes occurring during preg-\par
nancy was pronounced as follows.  the\par
described substance diminishes maternal glu-\par
cose consumption through the elevation of\par
plasma free fatty acids, or by direct in-\par
hibition of glucose uptake, or both.  this\par
permits a preferential shunting of glucose\par
to the fetus.  at the same time, increased\par
plasma free fatty acid levels would serve\par
as the alternative maternal energy substrate.\par
elevated maternal insulin levels during\par
late pregnancy stabilize the degree of maternal\par
lipid mobilization.  the contrainsulin\par
properties of a substance capable of mobilizing\par
free fatty acids and inhibiting mater-\par
nal glucose utilization would pose a diabetogenic\par
challenge, and in the face of com-\par
promised maternal insulin reserves, provoke\par
overt or worsen existing diabetes\par
mellitus.\par

3682. metabolism of free fatty acids during perinatal life of lambs\par
there is a rapid rise of free fatty acids\par
in blood plasma after birth in newborn\par
lambs.  this study confirms this rise,\par
caused by an augmented mobilization of these\par
acids from the tissues.  norepinephrine\par
easily mobilizes free fatty acids in adult\par
ewes.  in newborn lambs this special effect\par
is lacking, though cardiovascular re-\par
sponses are clearly demonstrable.  blocking\par
the sympathetic nervous system in\par
newborn lambs inhibits the rapid rise of free\par
fatty acids after birth.  this is com-\par
patible with the concept, that increased activity\par
of these sympathetic nerves after\par
birth is an important factor for free fatty acids\par
mobilization.  during intrauterine\par
life there is an ample study of carbohydrates\par
and the organism uses them as an\par
energy source.  hypoglycaemia resulting from\par
sudden carbohydrate deprivation at\par
birth, demonstrates with rising free fatty acids\par
the change-over to (tissue) fat as\par
main source of energy.\par

1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and the\par
carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman and\par
the fetus\par
in 20 parturient women who were given glucose\par
infusions during the expulsive stage\par
of labor, the authors were able to observe an unusual\par
hyperglycemia and a decrease\par
in unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-level\par
usually increases regularly\par
during delivery.  likewise, the values of esterified\par
fatty acids (efa) showed an in-\par
crease above the normally present levels in women\par
who had received a glucose in-\par
fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  the\par
results show that during delivery\par
both hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoids\par
are predominantly due to the energy\par
demands of the organism.  however, there is also\par
evidence that other, hitherto un-\par
known factors may play a role.  in the fetus,\par
the infusion of glucose leads to an in-\par
creased glucose retention.  the infusion, however,\par
does not bring about a decrease,\par
but, contrary to the expectations, an increase\par
in the uefa-values.  in general,\par
such a reaction is not found in any of the\par
subsequent periods of life.  further inves-\par
tigations were conducted in order to find an\par
explanation for the paradox uefa-\par
reaction.  as shown by an analysis of the lactic\par
acid and the pyruvic acid values, the\par
increase in the uefa can most probably not be\par
attributed to an impairment in the\par
fetal metabolic conditions.  the administration\par
of physiological saline infusions to\par
10 parturient women under equal conditions\par
revealed that the cause for the uefa-\par
increase can apparently neither be found in\par
hemodynamic changes due to the infusion\par
nor in changes of the electrolyte balance, but\par
rather in an adaptation insufficiency\par
of the fetal islet cells, respectively in a different\par
fat mobilization or fat deposition.\par

there was an inverse relationship be-\par
tween blood glucose in the normal infants and\par
ffa.  this relationship is altered in\par
the infant of the diabetic mother.  gas\par
chromatography of plasma indicated a higher\par
ratio of unsaturated to saturated ffa in\par
mothers compared to infants.  no pattern\par
differences were noted between the normal\par

no differences were noted between infants\par
of diabetic mothers and normals.  the\par

interrelationships of glucose and ffa in\par
the normal infant are different from those\par
in the infant of the diabetic mother, the\par
latter infant having a state of physiologic\par
hyperinsulinism; (2) plasma ffa in the\par

as part of a study to investigate metal chelates as possible reactivators\par
of phosphate poisoned acetylcholinesterase, it is shown that chelates act\par
as inhibitors of the enzyme.  in addition, copper and nickel chelates of\par
2-pyridinealdoxime catalyze the decomposition of dfp and sarin.  compared to\par
2-pam, however, these chelates are very poor reactivators, probably because\par
of an improper alignment of the oxine oxygen in the chelate-enzyme complex.\par

3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier node\par
an attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodal\par
potential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects of\par
nicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reduction\par
decreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened action\par
potential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitive\par
activity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightly\par
increased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under the\par
combined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodal\par
polarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.  the plateau\par
can be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude;\par
short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually with\par
increasing pulse strength.  increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; the\par
steep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau is\par
replaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potential\par
decline.\par
the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperature\par
reduction.  1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate of\par
rise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%\par
sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in the\par
presence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constant\par
of delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factor\par
of about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization is\par
slightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodal\par
action potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of na\par
permeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effect\par
could be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specific\par
sites at the membrane.\par

2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and its\par
metal chelates as a function of retention at the injection site\par
the carcinogenic activities of s.c. administered\par
n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene\par
(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greater\par
activity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at the\par
site of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surrounding\par
tissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf\par
(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at the\par
sites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,\par
or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4\par
injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf was\par
retained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelates\par
and the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; the\par
half-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparable\par
half-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metal\par
derivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidences\par
of mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retention\par
times of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelate\par
of n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,\par
but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the material\par
at the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities of\par
the metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possible\par
importance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellular\par
constituents.\par

12083. generation of action potentials in single ranvier's nodes of isolated\par
frog nerve fibres under the influence of nickel and cadmium ions (russian)\par
by experimenting on single ranvier's nodes of frog isolated nerve fibres it\par
was shown that, along with a marked prolongation of the repolarization\par
phase of the action potential (ap), ni and cd ions also caused a rise of\par
the critical membrane depolarization level and an increased ap amplitude\par
with somewhat reduced steepness of its ascending phase.  ni and cd ions\par
restored the ap generation in the nodes of ranvier altered by a 0.01% procaine\par
solution, by an excess of potassium ions 00mm/1. of kcl) or by slight\par
mechanical injury during dissection.  it was only with a reduced na\par
concentration in the medium that the restoration of ap could be achieved.\par
ni and cd ions considerably slowed down and weakened the cathodal rise of the\par
critical level and the ap reduction.  cysteine (10 -2 to 10 -3 m)\par
eliminated all the effects of the mentioned ions.  a suggestion is made that by\par
binding the sh-groups of the nerve fibre proteins, nickel and cadmium reduce\par
the rate of inactivation and the increase of potassium permeability in\par
depolarization and also weaken the initial inactivation and the increase of\par
potassium permeability in depolarization, as well as weaken the initial\par
inactivation of the membrane (i-h), whenever this happened to be raised by\par
previous influences.\par

either.  the child could not read or copy a text, but was fully able to write\par

a 56-year-old right-handed man, following the formation of a left posterior\par

interpretation, which resolved, and color agnosia, which persisted.  the latter\par
impaired the use both of color information and of the names of the colors.\par
this may be explained as a disorder impairing the recollection and formation\par
of associations between color names and other types of information, with\par
resulting interference in any task in which colors or their names have\par
to be placed in a specific context.  the alternative views of willbrand (1887)\par
that here a limited dysphasia, and of sittig (1921) that a recognition defect\par
is simultaneously present, cannot be excluded.  in the present and in\par
previously reported cases the causative lesion seems to have been posteriorly\par

of the tumor on the lower side of the chiasma.  hence its start with upper\par
quadrantic field defects.  in this stage the visual disorder is amenable to\par
prompt and complete restoration.  with progressing growth of the tumor the\par
second stage follows as consequence of constriction by the circle of vessels.\par
in this stage nerve fibers are being destroyed.  therefore, after pressure\par
relieving operation no restoration occurs, or to a limited extent only.\par

twelve patients are described with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms resulting from\par

predominant disturbances in visual object recognition (visual agnosia) and\par
disturbances of visual spatial localization.  group iia  those having defects\par
in voluntary control of eye movements (ocular motor apraxia).  group iib  those\par
with persistent palsies of conjugate gaze.  although these symptoms may be\par
present to some extent with unilateral lesions, they are much more profound\par
and less able to be compensated with bilateral lesions.  the evidence in the\par
present cases suggests a biparieto-temporal localization for the lesions\par
causing visual agnosia, disturbances of spatial localization, and ocular motor\par
apraxia, and a more frontal localization for the lesions causing prolonged\par

1303. the problem of visual agnosia\par
this is a critical assessment of the ancient and modern theories on visual\par
agnosia.  an original description of the subjective world of these patients is\par
also given.  visual agnosia is a rare disorder, but it has led to comprehensive\par
discussions, for instance, by the fact that the problem of normal visual\par
perception is always involved.  bay's view, which denies the existence of\par
agnosia as a separate phenomenon in perception disorders, is especially dealt\par
with.  it is affirmed that no case has been described in the literature\par
in which visual agnosia is decidedly a pure and isolated phenomenon.\par
mostly there are also disturbances in the intellectual interpretation of visual\par
data.  often there is metamorphopsia or asthenopia.  there is no localized\par
prestriate gnostic center for visual impressions.  the older concept of higher\par
and lower levels of perception and perception disorders is also criticized.\par
visual perception is not a passive, but a very active process, in which\par
neurophysiological and psychological aspects are involved.\par
each of these can be\par
disturbed, leading to various degrees of visual perception disturbance.\par

a survey of the effects of hyperbaric exposure on 62 medical personnel exposed\par

effect.  pain in the ears or sinuses was the most common symptom but could\par
often be ameliorated or avoided by the valsalva technique of forced\par
insufflation with the nostrils occluded.  the most serious symptoms\par
encountered were 3 episodes of transient homonymous hemianopsia.  the\par
classic symptoms of decompression sickness\par
extremity pains (the 'bends'), pulmonary or\par
substernal distress (the 'chokes'), and skin dysesthesias occurred only rarely,\par
and were so mild or so fleeting as to require no treatment.  a further\par
reduction in symptoms without increase in decompression time may be\par
obtained by the inhalation of 100% oxygen during decompression stops at\par
pressures below 26.8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).\par

this is a report of 2, right-handed adults who had 'visual agnosia (with\par

nonexistent when the patient simply viewed the material (static method) but\par
if the letter was slowly developed for them, they were able to identify it\par

the left occipital lobe for an angioma.\par

.W\par
1388. optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspects\par
the authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey of\par
pathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original and\par
traditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity to\par
recognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  the\par
psychological studies on perception and the modern physiology of\par
vision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and\par
to affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound and\par
function in unison.\par
every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it is\par
therefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain a\par
congruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through an\par
exploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we are\par
confronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate\par
dynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and\par
spatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and often\par
complex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, and\par
tachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by such\par
methods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological\par
disturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of\par
visual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception of\par
movement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light and\par
darkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,\par
at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic'\par
behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot always\par
be explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a function\par
complementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptive\par
processes, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latest\par
neurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility and\par
proprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, and\par
vestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance is\par
attached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances with\par
altered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the corresponding\par
half-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factors\par
responsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  in\par
the light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitable\par
semeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their cases\par
into 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which altered\par
visual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of its\par
complementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated with\par
a homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which the\par

2568. clinical observations on hemianopia (japanese)\par
the clinical findings in 19 cases of hemianopia were analyzed.  hemianopia was\par
caused most frequently by vascular lesions of the central nervous mianopsia,\par
and by tumors.  wilbrand's prism sign, which is generally taken as evidence\par
of an optic tract lesion, was positive in one case with a parietal lesion.  no\par
case showed a cogwheel movement of the eyeball.  optokinetic nystagmus was\par
positive in 3 cases, one of which proved to have a parieto-occipital aneurysm.\par
the etiological factor could not be identified in the remaining 2 cases.\par
macular sparing was found to be symptomatic of an occipital lobe lesion.\par
incongruity of the 2 fields was observed in 2 cases with an occipital lobe\par
lesion.  as for the prognosis, hemianoptic field defects remained stationary in\par
cases of vascular lesions.  on the other hand perfect recovery of the visual\par
field defect occurred in cases with an occipital lobe tumor and in hypophyseal\par
hypertrophy caused by pregnancy.  the visual acuity of hemianoptic patients was\par
fairly good and no deterioration occurred during the observation period of\par
about 4 years.  only one patient out of the present series died.  these results\par
suggest that a favorable vital prognosis can be accorded to hemianoptic\par
subjects.\par

375. hemianopsia and glaucoma\par
after a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations on\par
the simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states on\par
the basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsias\par
occasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can be\par
established between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,\par
however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinal\par
detachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exact\par
perimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser rate\par
than in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into consideration\par
also in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatous\par
patient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visual\par
field defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, the\par
simultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether the\par
binasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of a\par
glaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes an\par
independent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarified\par
in the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebral\par
vessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even if\par
this role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases of\par
binasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnostic\par
and therapeutic measures are carried out.\par

1131. disorders of oculomotor functions in lesions of the optic pathway at the\par
parieto-occipital level and their significance in topical diagnosis\par
paresis of ocular movements to the hemianopic side is described in 9 patients\par
with acute vascular lesions in the parieto-occipital region.  in 7 cases the\par
paresis was of the dissociated type with inability to follow the moving finger,\par
while ocular movement in a verbally stated direction was quite normal.  in the\par
remaining 2 patients in whom the oedema extended into the frontal region there\par
was complete paresis of all conjugate movements.  conjugate paresis receded\par
hand-in-hand with the parietal symptomatology even if the hemianopia\par
persisted.  the oculomotor disorders referred to have never been observed in\par
lesions which did not extend beyond the occipital region.  conjugate\par
paresis has in all cases drawn attention to the presence of hemianopia\par
unobserved by the patients and this has led to a more accurate topical\par
diagnosis.\par

the therapeutic effectiveness of 6-thioguanine has been evaluated over the past\par
3 years in 19 patients with diverse syndromes.  only patients with severe\par
debilitating disease unresponsive to conventional therapy were treated.\par
remissions occurred in 2 of 5 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, in 1\par
patient each with dermatomyositis and necrotizing angiitis, 2 patients with\par
psoriasis and 2 of 4 patients with atopic disease.  improvement occurred in\par
other patients with these diseases and in 2 of 4 patients with\par
neurodermatitis.  two patients with scleroderma experienced only\par
equivocal benefit.  significant toxicity attributable to the drug\par

these agents in therapy requires further study.  hypotheses regarding the\par
mechanism of action of these agents and the significance of clinical\par

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupus\par
erythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)\par
from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,\par
rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases of\par
hyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particular\par
organs.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomes\par
less significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly be\par
supposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring in\par
a state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,\par
a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,\par
nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also in\par
pn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle is\par
a syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to consider\par
whether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal to\par
an auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of the\par
auto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.\par

420. therapy of lupus nephropathies by 6-mercaptopurine\par
corticosteroid therapy improved the general prognosis of sle, but has no\par
detectable effect on the nephropathy and this is actually the main cause of\par
death.  a new therapeutic method is presented using 6-mp purinethol (leupurin)\par
which produced 2 remissions in 6 consecutive cases total and in 4 cases\par
with severe nephropathy definite remission.  it should be emphasized that 5 of\par
the cases reported had definite npn elevation, accordingly they are considered\par
hopeless.\par

immunocytochemical observations\par
a firmly established case of lupus erythematosus with histologic\par
characteristics of periarteritis nodosa and fatal hemorrhage is presented.\par
immunocytochemical studies were done to explore the possibility of the vascular\par
lesions being immunological in type.  by immuno-fluorescent techniques\par
y-globulin, human serum complement, albumin and fibrinogen were demonstrated in\par
the vascular lesions.  y-globulin in the renal glomeruli was associated only\par
with complement.  the conclusion is that lupus erythematosus is primarily an\par
immunological disease with complex auto-immune mechanisms operative.\par

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note of\par
caution\par
azathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classified\par
as 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1\par
patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in\par
8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects of\par
azathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because of\par
the concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.\par
however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2\par
patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in\par
2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during the\par
administration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolonged\par
steroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine was\par
associated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which did\par
not respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressive\par
observations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,\par
as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration of\par
azathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneys\par
or the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other with\par
serum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,\par
and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8\par
patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporary\par
alopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or\par
3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.\par
azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis\par
noted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use in\par
severe ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.\par
azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered for\par
moderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlled\par
and prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with careful\par
supervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.\par

statistics were compiled from a total of 560 cases chosen at random, of\par
cirrhosis of the liver.  the figures refer to the age and sex of the patients,\par
as well as to the etiology and the hepatic morphology.  as the date of death of\par
304 of the subjects was known, it was possible to calculate the survival time\par
after the diagnosis was made.  only 36% survived the time of diagnosis by 1\par
year, 16% by 3 years, and 8% by 5 years.  these figures show that modern\par
therapy of liver cirrhosis has up to now not succeeded to prolong the life of\par
the majority of the victims.  in many cases, however, it is possible to a large\par
extent to relieve the patients' suffering by improving the appetite and the\par
general condition and by eliminating ascites and periods of hemorrhage and\par
stupor.  particular attention should be paid to the prophylaxis of the disease\par
and, by studying the survival time assessments and therapeutic reports, to the\par

etiological factors, the systemic manifestations, the survival rate, the\par
histological appearances, the biochemical tests, the autoimmune reactions\par
and the results of the immunosuppressive drugs.  from this study a concept\par

prolonged induction time and suppressed peak titer maximally\par
when immunization was performed one to three days prior\par
to drug treatment.  vinblastine did not affect peak titer, but did prolong\par
induction time when antigen was given 2 days prior to drug treatment.\par
cyclophosphamide markedly prolonged induction time and suppressed peak titer\par
irrespective of the time of antigen administration.  the antimetabolites\par

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renal\par
homotransplantation\par
dammin g. j.\par
a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs has\par
been completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.\par
over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.\par
increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questions\par
regarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprine\par
and diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%\par
100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  all\par
animals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapy\par
can be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneys\par
apparently are protected in some way in the new environment because a\par
second donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantation\par
of a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decrease\par
in renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted back\par
to their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,\par
non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for the\par
prolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a double\par
dose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption or\par
metabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results because\par
two kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in the\par
same drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient and\par
this sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned from\par
drugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidney\par
homografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejected\par
within 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidney\par
homografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from the\par
same donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidney\par
survival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by the\par
production of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.\par
additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,\par
are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalized\par
immunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.\par

3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiography\par
the myocardial toxicity of many current and\par
some experimental contrast agents\par
has been studied in dogs, by use of a previously\par
unreported method of occlusion\par
retrograde coronary venography as well as the\par
familiar technique of selective\par
coronary arterial catheterization.  the following\par
conclusions appear justified in\par
the light of the experiments   not only the\par
iodine-containing radicals with which the\par
contrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,\par
diatrizoates, iothalamates,\par
etc.), but also the final salification products appear\par
to be responsible for the widely\par
divergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrast\par
agents, to the point that differ-\par
ent salts of the same compound behave as entirely\par
different agents both chemically\par
and biologically.  the results seem to indicate the\par
dominance of sodium ion and/or\par
the protective effect of methylglucamine salts with\par
respect to the myocardial toxi-\par
city of current radiopaque media.  reported,\par
yet unexplained, electrocardiographic\par
changes occurring within one to two seconds\par
from the beginning of massive caval\par
high-pressure injections appear to find a\par
causal relationship in the myocardial ir-\par
ritability induced by the distention of the\par
coronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-\par
tion which is intentionally enhanced with\par
our retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-\par
culiar trait, shared in varying degrees by\par
all radiopaque agents tested, is their\par
ability to increase coronary blood flow.\par
the clinical significance of this phenome-\par
non, however, remains to be established.\par
these studies re-emphasize the limita-\par
tions of the standard toxicity studies conducted\par
in animals.  it should be clear from\par
the results reported that agents to be\par
administered into the coronary circulation\par
demand investigation in regard to their\par
potential toxicity by the methods described\par
herein or variations thereof.  in fact,\par
similar tests should be carried out for all or-\par
gans to be subjected to radiographic\par
examination via the vascular bed.  the authors\par
hope that this presentation will stimulate\par
renewed investigation, particularly in view\par
of the growing clinical applications of\par
selective cardiovascular opacification tech-\par

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,\par
unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and their\par
validation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects of\par
muscular exercise\par
a method is described which permits\par
measurement of relative changes in the exter-\par
nal dimensions of individual cardiac\par
chambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,\par
unanaesthetized man.  it consists of\par
suturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalum\par
clips to the surface of the heart at the\par
time of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-\par
tive period, cineradiograms are\par
obtained and the distances between clips are mea-\par
sured on each individual frame.\par
this technique has been found to be safe and has\par
been employed in 68 patients without\par
any complications.  as a result of studies in 8\par
patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,\par
the effects of rotation of the heart in the\par
sagittal plane during the cardiac and\par
respiratory cycles were determined precisely.\par
if clips were properly placed on the heart,\par
the possible errors resulting from such\par
rotation were found to be quite small.\par
during inspiration right ventricular dimen-\par
sions increased, while the opposite occurred\par
during expiration and during the val-\par
salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensions\par
exhibited little change during normal\par
respiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,\par
the changes in dimensions of the left\par
ventricle lagged behind those of the right\par
ventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-\par
diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes in\par
the dimensions of the left ventricle was\par
smaller than that which occurred in the right\par
ventricle.  the effects on ventricular\par
dimensions of light muscular exercise performed\par
in the supine position were studied\par
in 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensions\par
decreased by an average of 6.0% of con-\par
trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of\par
5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-\par
tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%\par
of control in the right ventricle\par
and by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.\par
these decreases are considered to\par
approximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.\par
in the 4 patients in whom the\par
rate of right ventricular pressure rise was determined\par
continuously, exercise re-\par
sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricular\par
end-diastolic dimensions decreased.\par
these data are interpreted to indicate that an\par
increase in myocardial contractility\par
occurs during muscular exercise in man.\par

five cases of aberrant coronary artery are\par

endocardial fibroelastosis.  clinical and\par
electrocardiographic features may suggest\par
the proper diagnosis, but only angio-\par
graphy can conclusively demonstrate the\par
continuity between the pulmonary artery\par
and the left coronary artery.  in these cases,\par
blood flow was from the pulmonary\par
artery to the coronary artery (forward) in 2\par
cases, and from the coronary artery\par
to the pulmonary artery (retrograde) in the\par
other 3.  when the diagnosis of aberrant\par
coronary artery is suspected, selective\par
left-sided angiocardiography should be the\par
angiographic procedure of choice.  the differentiation\par
from endocardial fibroelas-\par
tosis and other myocardiopathies is usually not a\par
problem with such a study, but\par
may be more difficult with intravenous angiocardiography.\par
with this latter type of\par
study, the coronary arteries are not generally visible,\par
but a persistently thin la-\par
teral aspect of the left ventricular wall should suggest\par
the proper diagnosis.  sub-\par

4159. detection of heart shunts by means of i 125\par
external scintillation detection of a pure dilution\par
curve originating in the right ven-\par
tricle has been pursued by investigators for many\par
yr.  the use of the soft photons\par
of 125 i offers an improved method of determination\par
by allowing excellent collimation\par
through 2 mechanisms  (1) a small half value layer\par
of 2 cm in tissue, and (2) uni-\par
directionality, in part due to all-or-none photoelectric\par
absorption of these photons\par
as compared with the pluridirectionality due to compton\par
scatter in the case of 131\par
i.  in 30 normal individuals, externally detected dilution\par
curves from the right heart\par
ventricle and arterial dilution curves obtained by arterial\par
puncture are compared.\par
five hundred microcuries of 125 i are injected into an\par
antecubital vein.  the amount\par
of radiation absorbed from a 500 uc dose in an adult of\par
70 kilos is 1000 to 2000\par
mrads when injected in the form of 125 i iodide.  the use\par
of 125 i orthoiodohippu-\par
rate is advised due to its short biological half-period and\par
the integrated whole-body\par
radiation exposure is decreased 100-fold in comparison\par
with the 125 i iodide.  the\par
shape of the right heart curve is very similar to the arterial\par
dilution curve with a\par
13   5% excess of counts originating outside the right ventricle\par
area.  the descending\par
segment of the right ventricle curve has a minimum count rate\par
of only 12   2% of the\par
peak of the curve as compared with the arterial curve of 10\par
   2.5%.  a mean t 1/2\par
of the descending down slope of the right ventricle is 1.52\par
   0.45 sec. for the right\par
heart curve and 2.4   0.65 sec. for the arterial curve.\par
the clinical usefulness of this\par
procedure in 20 patients with atrial septal defects and 9\par
patients with ventricular sep-\par
tal defects is analyzed.  it seems possible to perform selective\par

spiratory disorders, were studied.  the results\par

previous reports.  only the cardiac index showed a\par
significant decrease with age,\par
while the reduction of blood volume and of pulmonary\par
blood volume was slight.  a close\par

intravenously injected radioiodinated oleic acid\par

in sufficient concentration to permit recording photoscans\par
of the heart in man.  in\par
3 fatal cases of massive septal myocardial infarction,\par
injection of the radioiodin-\par
ated fatty acid (rifa) was made during life; at necropsy\par
photoscans of the excised\par
heart showed a discrete area of absent radioactivity\par
corresponding to the infarcted\par
interventricular septum.  photoscans of the heart were\par
made during life in 42 pa-\par
tients, 9 of whom had suffered recent myocardial infarction.\par
there were definite\par
areas of deceased radioactivity corresponding to the location\par
of the infarction,\par
judged by the electrocardiogram, in 4, and probable areas of\par
decreased radioactivity\par
in 2, of the 9 cases of myocardial infarction.  the technic as\par
presently employed\par
just approaches the limits of definition of infarction in acute\par
cases.  modification of\par

2716. y-angiocardiography\par
recordings were made, simultaneously with\par
the y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an-\par
giogram by means of a collimator placed in\par
the left scapular region and of carotid\par
angiogram by a collimator centered on the axis\par
of the external auditory canal.  the\par
3 curves yielded very interesting information on\par
the chronology of the various car-\par
diac cycles.  the pattern of the pulmonary and\par
carotid y-angiograms was valuable\par
in several pathologic conditions.  it is more logical\par
to measure the cardiac output\par
on the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram,\par
especially if there are shunts.  the\par
pulmonary curve allows rectification of the time\par
constant of emptying of the left\par
cavities of the heart.  as regards chronologic\par
information on cardiac cycles, atten-\par
tion is drawn to the fact that in the pulmonary\par
circulation long and short circuits\par
can be demonstrated.  the characteristic times\par
can be measured.  between the time\par
that the radioactive material appears in the left\par
cavities and the time that it leaves\par
the carotid, there is an interval of 3-4 systoles,\par
which represents the time neces-\par
sary for left circular filling.  the validity of\par
calculation of the cardiac output with\par
the stewart-hamilton formula is discussed.\par
this is valid if the collimator covers\par
a small volume of the principal channel.  it remains\par
to be shown if such a calculation\par
is valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, through\par
which the radioactive material\par
passes successively, and which have different c (t)\par
functions as well as for all tissue\par
'seen' by the collimator, some of which are not yet\par
irrigated with the radioactive\par
blood, while in other areas recirculation has already\par
started.  these aspects, and\par
their application to the pulmonary angiogram, are\par
discussed in detail.  with the\par
authors' technique, y-angiogram is\par
especially valuable, as correc-\par
tion for the time constant of the decrease of the left\par
peak is based on the lengthening\par
of this curve.  this again serves as a basis for\par
determining the left ventricular\par
volume.\par

performed according to donato's\par

output were found to be decreased\par
in mitral stenosis, the right ventricular evacuation\par
ratio diminished, and the pul-\par
monary circulation time prolonged.  the results\par

3056. the localization of aortic shunts developed by a precordial\par
registration of i 131 injected into the aorta at different levels\par
a technique for localizing shunts of aortic origin\par
is described, based on the analysis\par
of precordial records of i 131 injected at different\par
aortic levels.  seven patients with\par
patent ductus arteriosus (pda), 1 with a\par
coronary av fistula, 2 with ventricular\par
septal defect (vsd), 1 with atrial septal defect\par
(asd), 3 with mitral regurgitation,\par
2 with aortic regurgitation and 2 with systemic\par
hypertension were studied.  retro-\par
grade arterial catheterization by seldinger's\par
technique was performed in all the\par
patients, as well as right-sided catheterization\par
in those with congenital cardiopathies,\par
and transseptal catheterization in those with\par
valvulopathies.  a dose of 5-15 uc of na\par
i 131 was injected at the levels of the aortic root,\par
the ascending aorta, the aortic arch,\par
the origin of the left subclavian artery (ductus\par
level) and the descending aorta (post-\par
ductus level).  precordial curves were obtained by\par
means of a 2-inch thallium-acti-\par
vated nai crystal focused over the 3rd left intercostal\par
space at the sternal margin.\par
the shunt outlet can be detected by obtaining\par
simultaneous venous dilution curves\par
from the right chambers and the pulmonary artery.\par
the latter technique was used\par
in 2 patients with pda, 1 with coronary av fistula\par
and 1 with vsd.  these curves\par
were obtained by continuous withdrawal of blood which\par
had flowed through a well\par
scintillation counter.  the crystal pulses were carried\par
to ratemeters which worked\par
with the following time constants  0.01-0.15 sec for the\par
precordial curves and 0.5\par
sec for the venous curves.  a direct recorder with a\par
5-mm/sec paper speed was\par
used.  normal precordial curves after injecting above\par
the aortic valve were obtained\par
in patients with arterial hypertension, mitral regurgitation\par

swift downslope which fell down near the baseline level and\par

1671. the use of 99m tc pertechnetate in cardiac scanning\par
technetium 99m pertechnetate has been utilized\par
in the aas' laboratory for scanning the\par
cardiac blood pool.  the delineation of the heart\par
pool and surrounding vasculature\par
is comparable to that obtained with the standard\par
131 i compounds now in use.  in the\par
authors' hands 99m tc had the following advantages\par
since they routinely utilized\par
99m tc for brain and thyroid scans, it is available,\par
eliminating the purchase and\par
shelf decay of other materials.  three to 5 mc quantities\par
may be administered\par
with relatively low patient radiation dosage.  the\par
associated high count rate permits\par
rapid scanning.  the identification of pericardial effusions\par
is enhanced by the radio-\par
activity in the stomach which in some cases becomes\par
abnormally separated from\par
the cardiac blood pool.\par

the physical properties, metabolism and\par

it is shown that with tc 99m the highest\par
'in vivo' counting rates are obtained for a\par
given internal radiation dose, so that mea-\par
surements of high statistical accuracy may\par
safely be made.  the y-ray energy is near\par
optimum for scanning and the observation of\par
transients allowing light-weight collima-\par
tors to be used.  while tc 99m tagged albumin\par
is considered superior to risa for ap-\par
plications such as brain scanning, placentography\par

output, i 123 if it becomes available will be preferable\par

2626. a study of central arteriovenous shunts by\par
precordial recording of radioalbumin dilution curves\par
precordial dilution curves of 185 patients were\par
studied, 56 of them without cardio-\par
vascular disease, 48 with central arteriovenous\par
shunts and 45 with various cardiac\par
diseases.  collimation was not used, allowing only\par
minimal quantities of radioactive\par
material (0.5-2.2 uc. of i 131-tagged albumin) to be\par
utilized.  the precordial focusing\par
zone was a critical factor in this technique.  the\par
application of different discrimina-\par
tion factors, among them the ratio between the\par
minimal concentration and the latter\par
-an index proposed here - made possible the\par
diagnosis in 46 of the 48 patients with\par
shunts.  this method was shown to be as sensitive\par
as classical oximetry done during\par
cardiac catheterization.  the curves in pure valvular\par
stenosis do not show similar\par
changes to the shunts.  on the other hand, these\par
changes are shown in certain val-\par
vular regurgitations.  this fact becomes the most\par
important limiting factor in the\par
diagnosis of central arteriovenous shunts.  cardiac\par
failure does not preclude the\par
diagnosis, providing one can exclude valvular\par
regurgitation by other means.  the\par
method is thus, in spite of its limitations, of extreme\par
value in diagnosing central\par
arteriovenous shunts, especially when the results are\par
analyzed together with clinical\par

2 failed to heterotransplant, even with\par
inocula of 10 6 cells.  similar differences in\par
heterotransplantability were observed\par
among the clonal derivatives of 2 of these\par
sublines.  although the modal numbers of\par
these sublines and clonal derivatives were\par
basically similar, ranging from 73 to 80,\par

of the histogenesis of these tumors and\par

malignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactions\par
to superinfection.  when new-born\par
hamsters were inoculated in the chest with\par
adenovirus 12, malignant tumors\par
developed in one or two months, in 16 animals\par
out of 22.  these tumors presented\par
an epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolar\par
origin.  they were transplant-\par
able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,\par
they consisted in the first few cultures of\par
macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.\par
in subsequent passages, there was a\par
progressive disappearance of the macrophages\par
and fibroblasts.  in some cases, the\par
culture after seven passages was of a purely\par
epithelial nature, and when it was\par
reimplanted into hamsters at this time it\par
gave rise to the rapid development of an\par
epithelial tumor.  in the tumor cultures,\par
no adenovirus could be demonstrated.\par
nor could cultures of the pulmonary tumors,\par
or cultures of normal hamster lung be\par
infected with adenovirus.  it appears that the\par

2774. pitfalls in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of broncho-\par
genic carcinoma\par
a necropsy study of 380 cases of extrathoracic\par
carcinoma revealed that pulmonary\par
metastases occurred in almost 50% of the\par
cases and bronchial metastases in over\par
25%.  there were 39 cases (10.3%) in the\par
series with clinical features simulating\par
bronchogenic carcinoma and in 24 (62%)\par
of these cases there was cytologic and/or\par
histologic confirmation.  carcinomas of\par
the pancreas presented the greatest source\par
of diagnostic error accounting for more\par
than one-third of the 39 cases; the primary\par
site second in frequency was carcinoma\par
of the kidney.  bronchial metastases were\par
chiefly responsible for the clinical,\par
cytologic, and histologic findings compatible\par
with the diagnosis of bronchogenic\par
carcinoma.  secondary growths in the lungs may\par
present roentgenologically as solitary\par
tumors indistinguishable from primary lung\par
cancer.  metastatic lesions in lymph\par
nodes, bronchi, and lung may exhibit pleomor-\par
phic features simulating squamous\par
cell carcinoma.  the diagnosis of bronchioloalveo-\par
lar carcinoma in resected lung tissue\par
is a presumptive conclusion inasmuch as the\par
identical morphological features may\par
be reproduced by metastases from duct or\par
glandular carcinomas.  the simulation\par
of bronchogenic carcinoma by metastatic tum-\par
ors occurs with sufficient frequency to\par
challenge the diagnostic accuracy of deaths\par
certified as bronchogenic carcinoma\par
with necropsy exclusion of other primary sites.\par

4396. effects of arginine deprivation, ultraviolet radiation,\par
and x-radiation on cultured kb cells.  a cytochemical and\par
ultrastructural study\par
cultured kb cells (derived from a\par
human oral carcinoma) grown in monolayers\par
were injured by one of three agents\par
starvation by arginine deprivation or treatment\par
with high doses of either ultraviolet\par
radiation or x-radiation.  the different agents\par
produced changes in nucleolar structure\par
and varying accumulations of triglyceride\par
and glycogen.  all three agents produced\par
an increase in number and size of lyso-\par
somes.  these were studied in acid\par
phosphatase preparations, viewed by both light\par
and electron microscopy, and, occasionally,\par
in vital dye, esterase, and aryl sul-\par
fatase preparations.  ultrastructurally,\par
alterations in lysosomes suggested that\par
'residual bodies' developed in a variety\par
of ways, i.e., from the endoplasmic retic-\par
ulum, multivesicular bodies, or autophagic\par
vacuoles.  following all three agents,\par
the endoplasmic reticulum assumed\par
the form of 'rough' or 'smooth' whorls, and,\par
after two of the agents, arginine\par
deprivation or ultraviolet radiation, it acquired\par
cytochemically demonstrable acid\par
phosphatase activity.  near connections between\par
the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes\par
raise the possibility that in kb cells, at\par
least when injured, the endoplasmic\par
reticulum is involved in the formation of\par
lysosomes and the transport of acid\par
phosphatase to them.\par

surgery of the heart\par
the operative technique of cardiac\par
surgery under conditions of deep hypothermia with\par
simultaneous use of a pump oxygenator\par
and cardiopulmonary bypass is described.  in\par
the majority of cases the patients were\par
cooled with water at 2 c. and the perfusion\par
volume was reduced by more than 50%\par
during hypothermia.  in others, a gradient of\par
10 c. between blood and water was\par
maintained and the perfusion volume was reduced\par
by less than 50%.  the data presented\par
show that neither technique leads to hypoxic\par
changes in the cerebrum and internal\par
organs, provided the mean arterial pressure\par
is kept between 70 and 90 mm. hg during perfusion.\par
the overall mortality in the\par
authors' 168 cases - most of which\par
had congenital heart disease - was 14.8%.  in 53\par
cases of tetralogy of fallot - most\par
of them cyanotic - the vsd was closed by taking\par
a flap of tissue from the crista supraventricularis.\par
in this group mortality was 24.5%.\par

ventricular power, oxygen consumption, and efficiency in dogs\par
multiple cardiac parameters have been measured\par
in 30 dogs cooled to 20 c. aortic\par
blood temperature.  the parameters have been\par
expressed both as absolute values\par
and as percentages of normothermic values.\par
at normothermia, dogs with closed\par
chest had an ascending aorta flow of 154%\par
and a left ventricular external power of\par
183% of the corresponding values for dogs\par
with open chest.  both ascending aorta\par
flow and left circumflex coronary artery flow\par
were reduced to 25% of normothermic level\par
at 20 c.  aortic arch mean pressure was\par
reduced to 50% of normothermic level\par
at 20 c.  total peripheral resistance was\par
increased to 205% of normothermic level\par
at 20 c.  left ventricular external power\par
was decreased to 11% of normothermic\par
level at 20 c.  left ventricular oxygen\par
consumption was decreased to 31% of nor-\par
mothermic level at 20 c.  mechanical\par
efficiency of the left ventricular myocardium\par
was decreased to 39% of normothermic level at 20 c.\par

pump oxygenator\par
the advantages of hypothermia of below 10 c for 2 hr,\par
induced and maintained by\par
extracorporeal circulation of 200 min.,\par
were compared to partial bypass of the\par
same duration during normothermia.\par
in the normothermic group 9 dogs out of 12\par
lived.  in the hypothermic group 6 dogs\par
out of 15 (40%) survived when perfused at\par
the high flow of 55 cc/kg/min.  eleven\par
dogs out of 15 (70%) survived when the flow\par
rate was reduced to 25 cc/kg/min when\par
the temperature was below 10 c.  the death\par
in the high flow group were due mainly\par
to postperfusion lung changes even when low\par
pulmonary venous pressure was assured\par
by venting in the left atrial chamber.  me-\par
tabolic acidosis occurred in all groups;\par
though greater in the high flow, with the\par
low flow intermediate between the former\par
and the normothermic group.  this change\par
to a great degree, can be explained by the lung changes.\par

1593. bleeding tendencies associated with profound-hypothermia technics in\par
neurologic surgery\par
forty-three patients with bleeding intracranial\par
aneurysms were operated on under\par
deep hypothermia and with the aid of extracorporeal\par
circulation.  the open-thorax\par
method was used in 18 cases and the closed-thorax\par
method in 25.  the following\par
points are made  (1) the closed-thorax method\par
is considered superior to the open-\par
thorax method in several respects; (2) meticulous\par
hemostasis is essential to control\par
the oozing that occurs during extracorporeal\par
circulation under profound hypothermia\par
until the heparin antagonist can become\par
effective and body temperature can return\par
to normal; (3) significant thrombocytopenia\par
may develop during extracorporeal cir-\par
culation, and inhibition of the thrombin-fibrinogen\par
reaction by factors other than\par
heparin may cause a major coagulation defect\par
and may also, by mimicking the he-\par
parin effect, lead to the excessive use of\par
heparin antagonists; (4) pathologic changes\par
in microcirculation during extracorporeal\par
circulation may be determinants of a\par
hemorrhagic tendency.\par

4088. the use of hypothermia and dehydration in the treatment of severe\par
cerebral hypoxia\par
the rational for using hypothermia or\par
cerebral dehydration is to suppress or re-\par
verse progressive or delayed cerebral\par
damage after hypoxia.  it is suggested that\par
damage of this nature results from injury\par
to the astroglia and oligodendroglia,\par
especially the former.  experimental and\par
clinical evidence favors lowering of the\par
body temperature immediately after any\par
episode of hypoxia accompanied by impor-\par
tant damage to the brain.  the rational\par
for using dehydration is insecure and its\par
results are uncertain.  this treatment\par
should probably be reserved for cases in\par
which a raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure\par
has been proved, and in which other\par
measures, especially hypothermia,\par
are either not available or have failed.\par

7828. selective cerebral hypothermia  physiology and technic\par
a safe, suitable technique for producing\par
selective brain cooling by a perfusion\par
method is described.  of 15 dogs, 7 survived.\par
the salient features aiding survival\par
are discussed.  the use of a direct vasodilator\par
(papaverine) in the perfusate to\par
relieve vasospasm markedly reduced cooling time\par
and represented the most signi-\par
ficant technical advance over previously\par
described methods.  an acid base analysis\par
utilizing the siggaard-andersen curve nomogram\par
was performed on 4 dogs and no\par
significant acidosis noted during selective brain\par
cooling.  a definite arteriovenous\par
lactic acid difference developed at hypothermic\par
temperatures indicating the brain\par
may metabolize this substance in preference to\par
glucose at lowered brain tempera-\par
tures, the reasons for which were discussed.\par
the rate of disappearance of physi-\par
cally dissolved oxygen (po2) was measured\par
in the brain following ischemia at dif-\par
ferent temperatures.  the average rate of\par
disappearance at 20 c. was 40% of the\par
rate at 37 c.  the discrepancy between this\par
finding and the in vitro oxygen utili-\par
zation rate at the same temperature was discussed.\par

948.cardiac activity in cranio-cerebral hypothermia\par
the onset of hypothermia rarely alters the heart\par
rate.  as it deepens to 35-32, the\par
rate slows, and at the level of 30-29 it usually\par
amounts to only half its original va-\par
lue.  at 28 or below, the development of\par
bradycardia is observed.  after warming\par
to 32 the normal heart rate is restored.\par
during operations on the abdominal organs\par
the heart rate is only slightly modified.\par
the appearance of solitary extrasystoles is\par
rare and is usually associated with stimulation\par
of the diaphragm.  the most marked\par
changes in the heart rate are observed during operations on the heart,\par
especially if\par
it is excluded from the circulation.  an\par
idioventricular rhythm may develop before\par
the heart stops beating.  after removal of the\par
ligatures from the venae cavae the nor-\par
mal rhythm is restored.  as the temperature\par
falls, the excitability of the myocardium\par
increases.  conduction is more resistant.\par
areflexia continues even during direct sti-\par
mulation of reflexogenic zones.  in the surgical\par
stage of cranio-cerebral hypothermia\par
it is clear that no significant degree of energy\par
or hemodynamic insufficiency deve-\par
lops, whether in experimental conditions or\par
during operations on patients.  at opera-\par
tion a well-marked stabilization of the contractile\par
power of the myocardium may be observed.\par

946. respiration in hypothermia.  i. respiratory pattern and\par
acid-base balance in the blood\par
mongrel dogs, under light pentobarbital anesthesia,\par
were made hypothermic by im-\par
mersing them in ice water and then normothermic\par
in warm water.  in the course of\par
cooling, the respiratory rate and pulmonary\par
ventilation, after an initial increase,\par
were reduced as the rectal temperature fell,\par
and spontaneous respiration was ar-\par
rested at rectal temperatures of 21-25\par
c.  alveolar pco2 was increased, after an\par
initial slight lowering, with the progress of\par
hypothermia.  arterial ph and standard\par
bicarbonate (jorgensen and astrup) decreased,\par
and the alkalinity of the blood coh/\par
ch (winterstein) decreased markedly during hypothermia.\par
these findings suggest\par
both respiratory and metabolic acidosis as the\par
mechanisms concerned.  in the course\par
of rewarming all these changes disappeared rapidly\par
and completely though the venti-\par
latory stimulation observed as an initial transitory\par
phenomenon during cooling failed to occur.\par

896. studies on blood viscosity and its significance in anesthesia\par
the principles for measuring blood viscosity\par
have been discussed.  although blood\par
does not behave in a newtonian manner,\par
the data obtained in in vitro measurement\par
are useful.  a modified simple method for\par
measuring blood viscosity relative to nor-\par
mal saline has been described.  there is\par
essentially no difference in viscosity be-\par
tween fresh blood and heparinized blood and between plasma and serum.\par
viscosity varies with the quantity and nature of proteins\par
in plasma and the cellular concentra-\par
tion.  halothane and thiopental sodium reduce\par
blood viscosity and seem to be indicat-\par
ed in conditions in which there is hemoconcentration\par
and a tendency for red blood\par
cells to aggregate.  cyclopropane, hypothermia,\par
and norepinephrine tend to raise\par
blood viscosity and would seem to be contraindicated\par
when the microcirculation is failing.\par

.W\par
4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermia\par
it is suggested that low flows are dangerous\par
and may cause anoxia either directly\par
or by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogs\par
have been subjected to local cerebral\par
hypothermia by the method of femoral to\par
carotid cooling of arterial blood with per-\par
fusion at a predetermined pressure rather\par
than predetermined flow rate.  the cir-\par
cuit is described and its advantages for\par
clinical use mentioned together with its in-\par
accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.\par
these are chiefly concerned\par
with maintenance of systemic blood pressure\par
which may require the injection of\par
pressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flow\par
at low temperatures is discussed\par
and evidence presented that this is not only due\par
to increase in viscosity but that\par
there is an active spasm, manifested by\par
'rewarming humps' which occur in the\par
cooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rates\par
were determined by a revolution counter\par
attached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,\par
the output of which was linked to the per-\par
fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.\par
the place of added co2\par
is discussed particularly in relation to the fall\par
in partial pressure which accompa-\par
nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2\par
did not increase total carotid\par
flows.  halothane had been used as an anesthetic\par
because of its sympatholytic ac-\par
tion.  it has increased flows by 37% and\par
abolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-\par
dex used as a priming fluid instead of blood\par
produced increased flow averaging 75%\par
but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested that\par
cooling faster than 1 c. per minute\par
is not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is prevented\par
and high flow maintained by the methods described.\par

4613. selective brain cooling produced by cerebral ventricular perfusion\par
hypothermic cerebral ventricular perfusion\par
was applied to dogs.  shivering appear-\par
ed to be directly related to the cns temperature\par
rather than the peripheral body\par
temperature.  selective heating of the brain-stem\par
produced panting.  rewarming\par
of the body was retarded by the initiation of heat\par
loss mechanisms controlled cen-\par
trally when hyperthermic perfusion was used.\par
shivering disappeared but panting\par
was unaffected by pentobarbital anesthesia.\par
cooling of one or both frontal areas and\par
the anterior part of the third ventricle did not\par
significantly affect the respiratory\par
or circulatory systems but brain-stem hypothermia\par
produced distinct respiratory\par
and circulatory reactions.  it is suggested that\par
cooling of the 3rd and 4th ventricu-\par
lar areas may be utilized for anesthetic purposes.\par

1139. optimal coronary flow in the bypassed normothermic and hypothermic heart\par
a series of experiments were conducted in dogs\par
in which bypass flow, temperature,\par
and direct coronary perfusion pressure were varied.\par
coronary flow, coronary ven-\par
ous saturation, myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2),\par
and coronary vascular re-\par
sistance were assayed.  coronary flow as a percentage\par
of total bypass flow did not\par
vary appreciably at varying levels of bypass flow.\par
induction of hypothermia, when\par
total bypass flow is constant, results in decreasing\par
coronary flow.  induction of hy-\par
pothermia when maintaining a constant bypass pressure\par
results in an increasing\par
coronary flow with temperatures down to 22\par
c.  further cooling causes a reduction\par
in flow.  using isolated coronary perfusion at 100 mm. hg,\par
coronary flow fell and\par
resistance rose during the first 15 min. of bypass.\par
using isolated coronary perfu-\par
sion at 100 mm. hg, induction of moderate hypothermia\par
(25 c.) caused an increase\par
in coronary flow and venous saturation and a decrease\par
in cardiovascular resistance\par
and mvo2.  under the same conditions, induction of\par
hypothermia to 18 c. produced\par
similar changes but caused myocardial hemorrhage\par
and ventricular fibrillation.  pro-\par
found hypothermia probably leads to excessive\par
fragility of the capillary bed.  reduc-\par
tion of perfusion pressure to 50 mm. hg at near\par
normothermia reduced coronary\par
flow and slightly reduced venous saturation\par
and mvo2.  the same reduction of perfu-\par
sion pressure at 18 c. produced similar but\par
less marked changes.  reduction to 25\par
mm. hg at 18 c. markedly reduced coronary flow,\par
venous saturation, and mvo2\par
initially, but with partial recovery later.  from this\par
data of acute experiments in\par
dogs, coronary perfusion using moderate hypothermia\par
(about 31 c.) and 50\par
mm. hg, slightly pulsatile mean pressure appears optimal.\par

perimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery and\par

this paper includes minor clinical notes\par
on open heart surgery and cancer perfusion\par
but contains no experimental information\par
on neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  a\par
method of closed-chest hypothermic perfusion\par
in 30 dogs is reported.  the authors\par
utilize drainage of superior and inferior cavae\par
by gravity.  the volume of venous\par
drainage sometimes enhanced by transfusions\par
or 12.5% low molecular weight dex-\par
tran determined the flow rate.  cooling was\par
maintained for quite variable periods\par
apparently generally to an unspecified\par
esophageal temperature.  perfusion time va-\par
ried from 30 min. to 4 hr.  animals with\par
low flows were perfused longer, had a high-\par
er incidence of ventricular fibrillation,\par
and a very low survival rate.  eleven ani-\par
mals survived.  all had pre-cooling flow\par
rates above 40 ml./kg./min., good flow\par
rates during the perfusion, and only 3 had\par
ventricular fibrillation.  flow rates and\par
survival were increased in animals receiving\par
low molecular weight dextran.  four-\par
teen of 15 animals with ventricular fibrillation\par
were defibrillated electrically, 8 re-\par
gained 'adequate' cardiac function, but only 3\par
survived.  some interesting data on\par
regional cooling of the lower half of the body\par
is presented.  the authors conclude\par
without sufficient evidence that the most\par
important factor in the mortality in hypo-\par
thermic perfusion is the ability to maintain\par
'a flow rate approaching the estimated\par
normothermic cardiac output of the animal'\par

2406. profound hypothermia\par
the aim of hypothermia is protection of vital\par
cerebral structures from hypoxia\par
during aneurysm repair; profound hypothermia\par
is also valuable in operating on\par
certain cardiac defects which cannot be repaired\par
even with whole body perfusion.\par
since the time needed for aneurysm repair often\par
exceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12\par
minutes without circulation afforded by surface\par
hypothermia of 29  to 30  c., the\par
authors have investigated the drew (open-chest)\par
technic, the closed-chest method,\par
and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technic\par
consists of substituting two\par
pumps for the heart while the patient's lungs act\par
as the oxygenator.  because of its\par
disadvantages (the large amounts of blood needed\par
and the morbidity due to intra-\par
cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), a\par
closed-chest method was developed,\par
using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenator\par
to provide the perfusion and\par
extracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.\par
in cerebral perfusion, blood\par
is taken from one artery, pumped through a heat\par
exchanger, and returned to another\par
artery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,\par
offer comparisons of the three\par
methods, give instructions pertaining to the production\par
of hypothermia, and list the\par
problems encountered in the management of these cases.\par

based on weight (20 ml/kg) and subjected\par
to cooling with the balloon filled maximally,\par
but safely to a pressure of 10 mm\par
hg.  consistently, the latter procedure was far\par
more efficient, averaging 2.6 times as\par
rapid for all degrees of hypothermia.  a\par
decrease in core temperature by 7 c re-\par
quired an average of only 28.4 minutes.\par
on comparison with clinical reports of hy-\par
pothermia induced by the usual gastric\par
cooling, an improved efficiency of two-fold\par
to three-fold is still noted.\par

grain counts transformation of a few lymphoid\par
cells into hemopoietic cells cannot be\par

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosis\par
in the thymo-lympha-\par
tic systems - with special\par
reference to the influence of\par
the thymus and the thyroid\par
in guinea-pigs\par
migratory streams of lymphocytes between\par
different parts of the thymo-lymphatic\par
system were evaluated by comparisons between\par
lymphocyte populations in thoracic-\par
duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,\par
especially thymic venous blood.  by re-\par
cording organ weights in sham-operated and\par
thymectomized guinea-pigs, treated\par
with thyroxin or untreated, the importance\par
of the thymus and the thyroid for growth\par
and regeneration in the thymo-lymphatic\par
system was studied.  the main results are\par
as follows.  there is a considerable venous\par
output of lymphocytes with low mito-\par
chondrial content (small lymphocytes) from\par
the thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.\par
this explains the much higher incidence of\par
small lymphocytes in blood than in tho-\par
racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomy\par
causes lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-\par
ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophilic\par
cells in relation to reticular ones.  body\par
growth and survival of the animals are not\par
affected.  in the thymus, exogenous\par
thyroxin most probably promotes differentiation\par
of large basophilic cells to small\par
lymphocytes, resulting in an increased output of\par
small lymphocytes.  in the lymph\par
nodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of large\par
pyroninophilic cells ('transitional\par
cells') into immature and mature plasma cells.\par
the effects of thyroxin on dif-\par
ferentiation are followed by an increased growth\par
of the thymo-lymphatic organs,\par
characterized by an increased incidence of large\par
basophilic cells and increased weight\par
of the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus and\par
lymph nodes precedes that of\par
the red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic response\par
is not due to a transformation\par
of an increased number of immigrated thymic\par
lymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomy\par
does not prevent the thyroxin-stimulated\par
occurrence of large basophilic cells in the\par
red splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulated\par
growth of the lymphatic system is ac-\par
companied by an increased output of larger\par
lymphocytes through the thoracic\par
duct, resulting in an increased number of\par
larger lymphocytes in the blood.  in\par
postnatally thymectomized animals, having a\par
normal (or above normal) amount of\par
circulating small lymphocytes, thyroxin produces\par
a drastic decrease in the number of\par
small blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreased\par
delivery and/or increased disappear-\par
ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.\par
this decrease in number of small\par
lymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.\par

from bone marrow in the rat\par
skin windows' and subcutaneous coverslips\par
were applied to rats in a study designed\par
to identify the tissues in which the precursors\par
of macrophages proliferate.  lympho-\par
cyte-depletion by either chronic drainage from\par
the thoracic duct or 400 rads of x-\par
irradiation failed to suppress the emigration of\par
macrophages or to reduce the pro-\par
portion of them which became labelled after an\par
injection of tritiated thymidine.  x-\par
irradiation with 750 rads suppressed\par
the emigration and the labelling of the exudate\par
macrophages.  both were restored to\par
normal when the tibial marrow was shielded\par
during irradiation.  radioactively-labelled\par
cell suspensions obtained from thoracic\par
duct lymph, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen\par
and bone marrow were transfused into\par
syngeneic recipients.  the emigration of\par
labelled macrophages on to coverslips\par
could be demonstrated only in recipients\par
of labelled bone marrow and spleen cells.\par
labelled monocytes were found in the blood\par
of rats which had received injections\par
of labelled bone marrow.  it was concluded\par
that in the rat, bone marrow, and to a\par
lesser extent spleen, are major sources of\par
the macrophages which emigrate into\par
foci of acute, non-bacterial inflammation.\par

after a large acute hemorrhage,\par
the absolute le-\par
vels of neutrophils, eosinophils, and\par

after a single he-\par
morrhage but in the later stages of\par
severe hypoxia their\par
numbers are greatly reduced.\par

stem cells in the bone marrow\par
is not unlimited, the de-\par
crease in marrow granulocytes\par

ing marked erythropoietic stimulation\par
appears to favor\par
a monophyletic theory of hemopoiesis;\par
a heavy demand\par
for stem cells to differentiate into the\par
erythron may\par
temporarily restrict the\par
number entering the leukon.  the\par
hypoxic animals showed\par
a considerable loss of body weight\par
and the notable reduction\par
of marrow lymphocytes in the\par
later stages of hypoxia\par
may be specifically related to a\par
generalized atrophy of\par
lymphoid tissue.  using h3-thymi-\par
dine there is evidence\par
of active dna synthesis in guinea\par
pig metamyelocytes.\par
although dna-synthesis was found\par
in metamyelocytes of\par
normal marrow, after hemorrhage\par
these cells form a much\par
larger proportion of the total\par
synthesizing cells in the\par
granulocyte compartment and\par
also the ratio of labeled\par
metamyelocytes to myelocytes\par
is considerably increased.\par
microspectrophotometric\par
measurements of the feulgen\par
dna-content of metamyelo-\par
cytes after hemorrhage show\par
that there are 2 populations\par
of these cells.  one group has\par
values typical of resting or\par
nonsynthesizing cells but a 2nd\par
group shows a complete\par
range of dna-values up to levels\par
characteristic of those\par
found in dividing cells.  certain\par
small mononuclear cells\par
with minimal but deeply basophilic\par
cytoplasm are a dis-\par
tinctive group of dna-synthesizing\par

by h-2 factors.  c57bl marrow, which\par
frequently regresses in irradiated f1 mice,\par
has shown to be relatively less capable\par
of repopulating the recipient than regularly\par

in the relative abilities of parental mar-\par
rows to repopulate f1 mice cannot as yet be\par
fully explained.  they might be corre-\par
lated with physiological differences between\par
the parental marrows or with a micro-\par
environmental advantage of one hematopoietic\par

were combined with\par
observations on the thymus, spleen\par

depletion coinciding with a\par
marked splenic hyperplasia.\par
both phenomena were eliminated\par

marrow of partially shiel-\par
ded animals continued to show\par
both the overshoot and the\par
secondary fall in numbers which\par
characterize recovery\par
from whole-body irradiation\par

in rabbits transfused with thymus cells and\par

of thymus cells caused a peripheral\par
lymphocytosis and a diminution of lymphoid\par

and adult rabbits.  the transfusion of lymphnode\par
cells resulted in a peripheral lympho-\par
penia, and an initial increase and a subsequent\par
diminution of lymphoid cells in the\par
bone marrow.  it is suggested that lymphoid cells\par
in the bone marrow may be lympho-\par
cytes which are stored or discharged according\par
to a variety of conditions.  further-\par

hypoxia quantitative studies were made\par
of the changes in the blood and bone marrow.\par
in secondary as in primary hypoxia there\par
is a significant increase in the nucleated\par
red cells of the marrow.  in secondary\par
hypoxia, however, there is a very marked\par

the numbers produced appear to\par
be considerable.  during recovery from irradiation\par
there are numerous telophases\par
in marrow smears which appear to be forming small\par
lymphocytes.  moreover, many\par
lymphocytes are still found in shielded bone marrow\par
after the rest of the body, in-\par
cluding the conventional lymphoid tissues, has\par
received lethal or supra-lethal irra-\par
diation.  almost 50% of these cells are formed\par
after the irradiation.  finally, when\par
bone marrow is cultured in the peritoneal cavity\par
of a host whose own lymphocyte\par
production has been suppressed by irradiation,\par
small percentages of newly-formed\par

experiments with injection of different\par

of extirpation of the shielded spleen\par
after irradiation indicate that approximately\par
3 x 10 4 cells of this type are required\par

a study was made of hyperbasophilic cells\par
which appeared following transplantation\par
of bone marrow to 20 irradiated mongrel\par
dogs of both sexes.  in the main series of\par
experiments the animals were irradiated\par
with a dosage of 600 r., using a four-tube\par

current 10 ma, filters 0.5 cu mm + 1.0\par
mm.al, target distance 60 cm., rate\par
18-22 r./min.  at 1-2 days after irradiation,\par
a suspension of bone marrow cells in a\par
dosage of 10 9 - 5 x 10 9 nuclear cells was\par
administered i.v.  the marrow was\par
obtained by aspiration from various skeletal\par
bones or by compression from the\par
sternum, ribs and other bones.  a study was made\par
of the morphological composition\par
of the blood and bone marrow before irradiation\par
and at 1-5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30\par
days after irradiation and transfusion of bone mar-\par
row, and thereafter at 10-15 days\par
intervals.  smears of blood and marrow were\par
stained with azure-ii-eosin.  it was\par
found that distinctive cells with basophilic proto-\par
plasm and frequent incidence of an\par
immature nucleus were present in the blood of\par
dogs following irradiation with 600\par
r. and transplantation of bone marrow.  hyper-\par
basophilic cells appeared in the blood\par
at 2 - 4 days after transplantation and attained\par
a maximum 14 - 21 days later; thereafter\par
their number diminished rapidly.  the\par
trend of number of hyperbasophilic cells\par
coincided with that of other donor elements\par
(leukocytes, erythrocytes).  hyperbasophilic\par
cells were not found during acute radia-\par
tion sickness in dogs which were not given\par
injections of bone marrow.  they were\par
found 3 mth. after transplantation of bone\par
marrow to nonirradiated puppies at 2-3\par
days of age.  when the irradiation dosage\par
was increased to 800-1,000 r., the number\par
of hyperbasophilic cells increased and\par
attained a peak sooner than after the 600\par

studied with tritium-labelled\par
thymidine\par
cytokinetic data are presented, employing\par
quantitation of h3dna in the lymphatic\par
tissues of normal rats serially sacrificed\par
after h3tdr administration.  a marked\par
difference in the patterns of initial labeling\par
and label loss was observed between the\par
thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue.\par
the data are compatible with other indica-\par
tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus.\par
there is suppression of initial uptake of\par
h3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocytic\par
progenitor cell in the thymus, appa-\par
rently because of a feedback of thymidine\par
containing material from small lympho-\par
cytes in the thymus.  depletion of the thymus\par
of small cells, as by operative stress\par
or whole body x-ray, leads to a marked\par
increase in the uptake of h3tdr into the\par
dna of large thymocytes.  this finding,\par
which is in agreement with the previous\par
findings of sugino et al. suggesting transfer\par
of thymine nucleotides from small thy-\par
mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may or\par
may not be related to the apparent\par
transfer of dna label between thymic cells.\par
the evidence for the latter consists of\par
the curvilinear dilution of the dna label in\par
the thymus proliferating cell population\par
and the relationship between the rate of dna\par
label dilution in large cells and the\par
dna in the small cells in the thymus.  after\par
the dna label in progenitor cells in\par
the thymus and lymph nodes has entered the\par
small cell population, the subsequent\par
dilution of grains in these dividing cells follows\par
the same slope as the loss of radio-\par
activity from the entire lymph node.  there is a\par
long retention of some h3dna label\par
in the dividing lymph node cell population.  this\par
suggests that the loss of radioacti-\par
vity from the dividing cells and from the small\par
cell population as a whole occurs e-\par
qually.  this pattern prevails regardless of\par
whether the percentage of large and\par
small cells is altered experimentally.  these\par
findings can be explained by an inter-\par
change of the dna nuclear label between small\par
lymphocytes and large lymphocytes.\par
this could occur by some process such as\par
phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans-\par
formation of the small lymphocyte into a large,\par
dividing cell.  the data fit best with\par
the latter possibility.  all or any of these\par
mechanisms would lead to an equilibration\par
of the dna label between large and small\par
cells.  this finding prevents the assign-\par
ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on\par
the basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne-\par
vertheless, there appear to be at least two\par
different types of lymphocytes.  one,\par
the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in the\par
thymus cortex, bone marrow and ger-\par
minal centers of lymphoid follicles.  the other\par
type, found abundantly in the wide-\par
spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows a\par
very prolonged retention of dna la-\par
bel and is believed to be recirculating,\par

by others.  these cells do not appear to\par
enter the thymus cortex.\par

extracts of human primary and secondary\par
mammary carcinomas were shown to\par
contain steroid sulfokinase(s) in every case\par
examined.  examination of normal\par
breast tissue surrounding the tumors revealed\par
very weak steroid sulfokinase\par
activity in some instances.  this was thought to\par
be due to the fibrous nature and\par
poor cellularity of the normal breast tissue.\par
normal ovarian tissue specimens,\par
obtained from cancer patients undergoing\par
oophorectomy, did not generally\par
contain the enzyme, but trace levels were detected\par
in 1 of 5 specimens examined.\par
steroids, without necessarily showing conversion\par
to steroid sulfate, were observed\par
to increase the incorporation of s35-sulfate into\par
one of the products formed enzy-\par

patients with advanced breast cancer\par
who subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-\par
tomy or hypophysectomy have been\par
found to excrete abnormal amounts of the\par
urinary metabolites of androgen and\par
cortisol.  when similar measurements are\par
carried out on patients with early breast\par
cancer, it is found that approximately half\par
the cases presenting for mastectomy are\par
also excreting abnormal amounts of these\par
steroids.  subsequent follow-up shows that\par
these cases tend to have a poor progno-\par
sis, and a trial had therefore been started\par
in which the abnormality is being cor-\par
rected.  in addition, it seems possible that\par
the deficiency in adrogen excretion may\par
precede the onset of the disease.  this\par
problem is being investigated in a trial\par
involving urinary steroid estimations in\par
5000 normal women.  the measurements\par
are being compared with the subsequent\par
development of breast cancer.\par

the urinary excretion of oestrone, pregnanediol and\par
pregnanetriol was determined\par
in a series of postmenopausal breast cancer patients\par
receiving no endocrine treat-\par
ment.  the steroid excretion was studied\par
both in relation to the age of the patients\par
as well as in relation to the time elapsed\par
since the last menstrual cycle.  the results\par
indicate that after an initial slow decrease\par
from the age of the menopause onward,\par
the excretion of oestrone and preganediol\par
increases again.  a new maximum was\par
found in the group 10-15 yr. after the\par
menopause.  the excretion of pregnanetriol\par
however, remains relatively constant\par
after a more rapid fall during the first few\par
years after the menopause.\par

ovarian irradiation and corticos-\par
teroids.\par
the urinary excretion of oestrone,\par
pregnanediol and pregnanetriol was determined\par
in breast cancer patients at different\par
stages of their endocrine treatment.  the\par
results demonstrate that corticosteroids\par
in substitution doses (cortisone 50 mg. daily\par
or prednisone 10 mg. daily, divided in 4\par
daily doses) are very effective in depressing\par
the excretion of all 3 steroids in postmenopausal\par
patients.  this is in agreement with\par
the clinical impression that these easily tolerated\par
small doses of corticosteroids have\par
the same therapeutic effect as adrenalectomy in\par
patients with breast cancer.  the\par
results indicate that the ovaries may contribute\par
to the production of oestrogens for\par
many years after the menopause, and that this\par
production is depressed by ovarian\par
irradiation.  this is in agreement with the clinical\par
observation that ovarian irra-\par
diation has a therapeutic value in postmenopausal\par
women with breast cancer.\par

corticosteroids oestrone excretion in\par
postmenopausal women diminished   67%.\par
a decrease of pregnanetriol ex-\par
cretion values was observed as well.  evidently\par
a low oestrone excretion in patients\par

complicated by amyloidosis (russian)\par
regression of amyloidosis in the early stages\par
seems possible and for this reason\par
russian clinicians are exploring the possibilities\par
of finding means of early diagnosis\par
of this complication.  the author studied 300\par
complete clinical blood analyses made\par
in 60 patients, viz. 30 with chronic fibrocavernous\par
and cirrhotic forms of tb com-\par
plicated by amyloidosis and 30 with the same forms\par
of tb without amyloidosis.  from\par
detailed serial study of the haemogram in patients\par
with pulmonary tb it is possible\par
to diagnose associated amyloidosis of the internal\par
organs in its initial stage.  the\par
presence of amyloidosis of the internal organs can\par
be inferred from the following\par
changes in the blood picture  (a) the appearance of\par
normochromic and hypochromic\par
anaemia in patients with various forms of tb (with\par
the exception of tb of the kidneys,\par
intestinal tract or larynx, and of caseous lymph\par
nodes), (b) progressive increase\par
in the leucocyte count with a neutrophil shift to\par
the left not corresponding with a\par
phase of quiescence of the main disease, (c) consistently\par
high esr in the absence\par
of an active process, (d) thrombocytosis in the phase of\par
subsidence of a flare-up,\par

acts through the immunity mechanism, it is\par
suggested that variations in the site,\par

2091. modern methods of treatment of visceral amyloidosis in patients with\par
pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)\par
the immediate and long-term results of\par
treatment during 1945-1962 of 414 patients\par
with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated\par
by amyloidosis were studied.  hormonal\par
(corticosteroid) therapy is the pathogenetic\par
treatment for visceral amyloidosis and\par
is indicated in the proteinuric and early\par
edema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis when\par
the functional capacity of the kidneys and\par
the liver is still adequate.  in the azotemic\par
phase of amyloidosis, hormonal (corticosteroid)\par
therapy is not indicated, since it\par
leads to rapid deterioration in the patient's\par
condition.  since hypoxemia is one of the\par
main factors in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis,\par
oxygen therapy is rational patho-\par
genetic therapy for patients with pulmonary\par
tuberculosis complicated by hypoxemia\par
and with symptoms of the proteinuric or\par
edema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis\par
(without ascites), in the form of\par
subcutaneous introduction of oxygen or oxy-\par
geno-peritoneum.  in patients with\par
pulmonary tuberculosis surgical interven-\par
tion on account of the main process\par
is indicated only in the early stages of amyloi-\par
dosis when pronounced functional\par
disorders of the kidneys and liver are absent.  co-\par
joint therapy using protein vitamins\par
(particularly ascorbic acid), hormonal (corticos-\par
teroid) preparations, oxygen and\par
desensitizing agents and elimination of all foci of\par
infection is indicated in treatment\par
of pulmonary tuberculosis with even the earliest\par
signs of amyloidosis.\par

the results of 86 puncture biopsies of the\par
liver in 84 patients with pulmonary tuber-\par
culosis (55 men and 31 women aged from\par
18 to 73 yr.) for the purpose of diagnosing\par
amyloidosis are reported.  puncture was\par
performed when amyloidosis was suspected\par
on the basis of the case history (destructive\par
process of more than 2-3 years' duration),\par
clinical signs in the form of enlargement of\par
the liver and spleen, edema, changes\par
in the blood picture and blood protein formula,\par
and changes in the urine (proteinuria,\par
cylindruria, isohyposthenuria).  amyloidosis\par
was diagnosed or its presence surmised\par
before puncture in 23 patients; the puncture\par
biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 14\par
and refuted it in 9 of them.  in 8 patients without\par
clinical symptoms, amyloidosis\par
was diagnosed on the basis of the puncture biopsy\par
alone.  in 9 cases with fatal out-\par
come, the post-mortem findings coincided with\par
the results of the bioptic puncture.\par
of the 62 patients in whom amyloidosis was not\par
detected by biopsy, 31 had moderate\par
dystrophic changes and 9 had marked dystrophic\par
changes while in 22 cases no patho-\par
logical changes were found; 6 of these patients\par
later developed amyloidosis.  these\par
findings supported the contention that liver\par
amyloidosis is linked with dystrophic\par
changes in the epithelial cells.  marked\par
dystrophic changes can precede amyloidosis\par
or may occur simultaneously with it.  moderate\par
dystrophic changes are quite common\par
in patients with an exacerbating tuberculous\par
process in the lungs.  the wide applica-\par
tion of bioptic puncture of the liver in indicated\par
cases can increase our knowledge\par
of the morphological changes taking place in the\par
liver in tb.\par

in patients with chronic fibrocavernous\par
tuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-\par
gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,\par
chronic foci or infection and diseases\par
with an allergic component can contribute\par
to the development of amyloidosis.  the\par
early detection and clearing of chronic\par
foci of infection and effective measures\par
against even mildly pronounced toxic-allergic\par
side reactions are of prime impor-\par
tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  the\par
unsystematic and prolonged administra-\par
tion of antibacterial preparations, along with\par
their toxic side effects, tends to in-\par
crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patients\par
with chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-\par
ary tb.  individual constitutional factors are\par
of great importance in the development\par
of side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,\par
in cases of hypofunction of\par
the liver and kidneys and autonomic\par
dysfunction promote the development of dys-\par
trophic processes, as is confirmed\par
by the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-\par
tions in patients with fibrocavernous\par
pulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.\par
the administration of desensitizing drugs\par
to patients showing side reactions there-\par
fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in cases\par
of chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-\par
therapy should be automatically combined\par
with the administration of desensitizing\par
and stimulatory drugs in this class of case.\par

(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)\par
quantitative determination of the urinary\par
steroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-\par
cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmed\par
that the 17-ketosteroids are always decreased\par
in these cases.  calciferol, in the form\par
of one ampoule of vit. d2 of 600,000\par
u. every 10 days, in combination with active\par
tuberculostatic drugs, in the majority of\par
the cases leads to an increase of the\par
urinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2\par
mth.  it appears that the calciferol\par
exerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulates\par
the liquefaction and evacuation of the\par
caseous material.  this proteolytic effect is\par
related to that of the mineralocorticoids,\par
which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-\par
stances.  calciferol offers the advantage\par
over these substances that it does not affect\par
the electrolytes and is well tolerated by\par
the organism.  for this reason, good results\par
may be expected from its administration\par
in cases of extensive pulmonary tb, in\par
which the myc. tuberculosis has remained\par
sensitive to the administered tuberculostic\par
drugs but nevertheless does not proceed\par
towards recovery because of the marked caseous\par
lesions.  in such cases calciferol treatment\par
leads to a rapid and pronounced decrease\par
of the radiological shadows, improves the\par
general condition and also modifies the\par
steroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.\par

7364. experimental amyloidosis in immunity\par
much of interest in the mechanism of\par
experimental amyloidosis as a result of the\par
parenteral introduction of foreign protein\par
has been centered around the nature of\par
the links leading to cytological and biochemical\par
changes in tissues and body fluids.\par
some of the authors suggested that such links\par
may be of immunological nature.\par
there is however, no clear-cut proof either\par
in favor of or against the theory of an\par
immunological origin of amyloid.  since\par
injection of proteins during the perinatal\par
period prevents an immune response when\par
the animal is subsequently challenged\par
with the same antigen, the authors studied\par
amyloidosis caused by casein in mice\par
treated after birth with this protein.  mice\par
exposed soon after birth to casein ac-\par
quire an immune tolerance to this antigen.\par
this was demonstrated by the absence\par
of circulating antibodies as measured by the\par
disappearance of i-labeled casein\par
from the circulation and by means of passive\par
hemagglutination tests with ascitic\par
fluids.  both tolerant and control animals\par
developed amyloidosis to the same extent.\par
the results imply that the pathogenesis of\par
amyloidosis does not rest upon a classic\par
immunological basis; they do not exclude\par
the possibility, that the disease may be\par
due to some auto-immune process.\par

3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosis\par
this study is particularly concerned\par
with  (a) the basal membrane in the different\par
stages; and (b) the intercapillary spaces\par
in the early stages.  the conclusions may\par
be put as follows  (1) the amyloid substance\par
seems to have a fibrillar structure\par
from the start.  (2) when the walls of the\par
peripheral capillary loops are thickened\par
by voluminous amyloid deposits, the\par
hyaline aspect of the primitive basal membrane\par
persists, but its structure is altered by\par
the presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.\par
(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,\par
amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the\par
'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; they\par
only appear on the epithelial and endo-\par
thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggests\par
that amyloidosis represents an\par
abnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, rather\par
than a transformation 'in situ'\par
of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stages\par
of amyloid infiltration into the\par
glomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first in\par
the intercapillary spaces, only\par
later does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.\par

affection of the kidneys is a complex and\par
prolonged process involving organic immune\par

auxotrophic strain (h25 his-and 168 tryp-).\par

ones.  this means that both strands of\par
the dna double helix can serve as templates\par

bacillus subtilis growing at 37  on\par
glutamate, as only carbon source, is induced\par
to form histidase by l-histidine.  this\par
enzyme, converting histidine to urocanic\par
acid, was isolated in a purified form.\par
a highly sensitive and convenient assay for\par
the induced enzyme is described and\par
applied to show that histidase appears in the\par
cell 5 min. after addition of the inducer.\par
histidase-synthesizing capacity appears\par
after 2 min. and decays exponentially after\par
addition of actinomycin (an inhibitor\par
of dna-dependent rna synthesis).  the\par
half-time value of histidase-synthesizing\par
capacity of 2.4 is high, compared with the\par
half-time value of messenger\par
rna.  the histidase formation after addition of\par
actinomycin was not only due to protein\par
synthesis directed by accumulated m-rna\par
but also by conversion of an enzymatical-\par
ly inactive protein, present on the moment\par
of actinomycin addition and product of\par
the specific m-rna, to the active enzyme.\par
the existence of this enzyme pre-\par
cursor was shown by means of experiments\par
performed in the presence of chlor-\par
amphenicof.  finally, numerical values for\par
the steady state of histidase synthesis,\par
reached 9 min. after addition of the inducer,\par
are calculated, on the basis of ki-\par
netics of histidase synthetic capacity, precursor\par
and enzyme formation  the cell\par
contains sufficient precursor to form\par
approximately 100 molecules of histidase.\par
the cell produces approximately 50\par
molecules histidase per min.  the cell ac-\par
quires and loses, every minute, the\par
capacity to make 15 molecules of histidase\par

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and their\par
parts. ii. bacterial cytoplasm\par
comparison of the fine structure of the\par
cytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that of\par
the 'cell in general' reveals important\par
differences leading to the conclusion that, in\par
the bacterial cytoplasm, there is little\par
differentiation into separate functional en-\par
tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, and\par
fine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-\par
plasm into the cytoplasm where they may\par
expand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is not\par
necessarily intersected by membranous\par
profiles of special configuration, as is borne\par
out by e. coli b and other gram-negative\par
organisms.  when membranous profiles\par
of special configuration are present, as\par
in the gram-positive b. subtilis, these\par
do not appear differentiated into clearly\par
definable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi\par
substance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.\par
as for kinetosomes, the presence\par
of centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  the\par
experiments in which tellurite is re-\par
duced in the cells suggest that there are\par
structures at the base of the flagella with\par
reductive capacity.  however, upon application\par
of the tetranitro-blue tetrazolium\par
technic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.\par
they are presumably identical with\par
basal granules.  the membranous structures\par
in b. subtilis are called chondrioids\par
by the author because probably one of their\par
functions is that they are the sites of\par
the respiratory enzyme chain.  in the\par
gram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable site\par
of the respiratory chain has a structure\par
very different from that in the bacillus; it\par
is not clear whether membranes are\par
involved in their structure.  morphologically,\par
even in b. subtilis chondrioids differ\par
fundamentally from the mitochondria in that\par
they are not built up from composite\par
membranes, they are extensions of the plasma\par
membrane, and they may not be completely\par
closed systems.  regarding this last\par
point, it was observed that chondrioids may\par
possibly stand in open connection with\par
the cell's environment, since its lumen is not\par
separated from the cell wall by a\par
plasma membrane.  although as yet nothing is\par
known about this, it does not seem to\par
be precluded that these membranous organelles\par
may function also as intracellular\par
transport systems.  contrary to porter's ideas\par
about er, the chondrioids are not\par
extensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the\par
plasma membrane.  on the other hand,\par
they are in the nuclear area, in direct contact\par
with the nucleoplasm, and therefore,\par
perhaps, they need not carry in their interior\par
some dna, as is now becoming known\par
for ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophore\par
vesicle is of a simple structure and\par
in connection with the plasma membrane.  it is\par
covered by a single membrane and\par
thus resembles the granum disc, but it is much\par
smaller.  in tissue cells, an im-\par
portant function of the er is the support of protein\par
synthesis by ribosomes bound\par
to their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulating\par
that the active complexes for poly-\par
peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-bound\par
and are series of 70s ribo-\par
somes using the same messenger rna molecule.\par
it remains a contradictory situ-\par
ation that the particles obtained here through release\par
of cytoplasm from protoplasts\par
in diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identified\par
as ribosomes, could not be\par
recognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenberger\par
fixed protoplasts.\par
this point is much in need of clarification.  but\par
even if the cytoplasm in the thin\par
sections of the protoplasts is in a state of\par
dispersion brought about artificially, it\par
is still apparent from the various micrographs\par
that basically the cytoplasm is a\par
network of presumably linear arrays, with many\par
interconnections due to fibrillar\par
systems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetrate\par
deeply into the cytoplasm.  the\par
presence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,\par
electron densities, and orientations\par
makes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmic\par
details an intriguing prospect from\par
which much fundamental information can be\par
gained.  the organizational pattern on\par
the ultrastructural level in bacteria reveals\par
fundamental similarities and divergen-\par
cies from that in the 'cell in general'.\par

906. molecular mechanism of genetic recombination in bacterial transformation\par
the mechanism of dna incorporation into\par
the recipient cell chromosome was in-\par
vestigated in a b. subtilis transformation\par
system.  the recipient cells were auxo-\par
trophic for 2 linked markers.  hybrid dna\par
used for transformation was heterozy-\par
gous for one of these markers.  no differences\par
in transformation activity were found\par
when the effect of native and hybrid dna was\par
compared.  according to the authors\par
this observation is easily explained if we accept\par
that each of both complementary\par
strands of the donor dna can be incorporated\par
into the recipient chromosome with\par
equal probability.  the results on the segregation\par
of genetic characters in the pro-\par
geny of transformed cells are also consistent\par
with the model of independent incorpo-\par
ration of both dna strands.  some calculations\par
were done on the probability of the\par
integration of a single dna strand carrying a\par
particular genetic marker, and on the\par
probability of recombination leading to double transformants.\par

the reproduction of bacteriophages requires\par

is accomplished by the same me-\par
chanism as ordinarily produces bacterial\par
proteins; however, for the synthesis of\par
nucleic acids (dna or rna) enzymes may\par
be required which are not present in non-\par
infected bacteria; their formation is then\par
induced by the virus itself.  the fundamental\par
biological processes of replication, transcription\par
and translation are discussed in\par
this context.\par

1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilis\par
the role of the inducer, l-histidine, in the\par
synthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-\par
monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.\par
it was found that induced cells poisoned\par
with actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,\par
lose their capacity for the forma-\par
tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a rate\par
which is independent of the presence\par
or absence of the inducer.  these results show\par
that the inducer does not increase\par
the intracellular level of histidase-specific\par
messenger rna by preventing the des-\par
truction of the major portion of this material,\par
the fraction that is engaged in pro-\par
tein synthesis.  the possibility has not been\par
excluded that the inducer exerts its\par
effect by bringing about the stabilization of\par
the messenger rna that is still attached\par
to dna or has not yet become attached to\par
ribosomes.  alternatively, the inducer may\par
actually stimulate the synthesis of\par
histidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver-\par
sion of the precursor to active enzyme\par
appears to involve polymerization of mono-\par
mers, rather than the release of\par
ribosome-bound inactive enzyme.\par

a method of extraction is described which\par

then be separated from the phage dna\par
on sucrose gradients.  the relative amounts\par
of phage and host dna made at various\par
times during infection of s. typhimurium\par
with phage p22 leading to lysogeny have\par
been determined.  phage-specific dna\par
synthesis begins at about 4 min, continues\par
to increase for 2-4 min, and then decreases\par
until complete repression is attained\par
at 16 min.  autonomous phage dna synthesis\par
remains repressed from then on.  bac-\par
teria-specific synthesis proceeds at a\par
decreasing rate until about 16 min, when\par
almost complete inhibition is reached.\par
when dna synthesis recovers in the in-\par
fected cells, only host-specific material\par
is made.  a new species of dna, which is\par
made only when phage dna is synthesized,\par
has been detected.  the possible implica-\par

438. lag period characterizing the entry of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid\par
into bacillus subtilis\par
the kinetics of appearance of transformants\par
as a function of time of exposure to\par
dna has been studied.  a short lag period\par
of approximately 1 min at 37 c is evi-\par
dent when the transformation is terminated\par
with deoxyribonuclease.  the length of\par
this lag is independent of the genetic trait\par
transferred.  moreover, the lag is unaf-\par
fected by transforming dna concentration,\par
by the presence of homologous unmarked\par
dna, and by shearing and cross-linking of\par
the transforming dna.  the lag shows\par
a strong inverse temperature dependence.\par
the energy of activation is 13.9\par
kcal.  the lag is abolished when the transformation\par
is terminated by washing instead of\par
by addition of deoxyribonuclease.  these results\par
are taken to indicate an immediate\par
adsorption of dna to cells, followed by a\par
deoxyribonuclease-sensitive period of\par
1 min, during which time the genetic trait\par
is entering the cell.  these results make\par

preceding the appearance of pairs of genetic\par
traits after the addition of dna to a\par
competent culture of b. subtilis.  the results\par
are taken to indicate that dna enters\par
competent cells in lengthwise fashion.\par
the smallest length of transforming dna\par
which can participate in a recombination\par
event, and the number of nucleotide pairs\par
which enter the cell per unit time, have\par
been estimated.  the evidence indicates\par
that only part of the lag period is devoted\par

2564. chemical inactivation and reactivation of transforming dna (russian)\par
the kinetics of the inactivation of linked\par
and unlinked genetic markers by means\par
of hno2 or uv light was studied.  closely\par
linked markers are inactivated simul-\par
taneously, unlinked markers are inactivated\par
independently.  it seems that the\par
chemical attack on dna impairs a large part\par
of macromolecule, including many\par
cistrons.  it was shown by genetic experiments\par
that chemical inactivation prac-\par
tically does not influence the process of dna\par
inclusion into competent cells.  by\par
means of viscosity measurements it was\par
shown that the molecular weight and\par
macromolecular properties of dna do not\par
significantly change during chemical\par
inactivation by means of hno2.  two explanations\par
for the inactivation of trans-\par
forming activity of dna are discussed  (1) structural\par
deteriorations, preventing\par
integration of dna molecule into the genome of\par
recipient cell, or (2) deletion of\par
a chain unit out of dna chain resulting in wrong\par
reading of code triplets.  it was\par
previously described in the literature that extensive\par
inactivation leads to a state\par
of dna, apparently more resistant than the initial one.\par
inactivation does not con-\par
firm to exponential kinetics.  the authors discuss the\par
coding mistake hypothesis\par
as an explanation for this remarkable fact.  extensive\par
hno2 or uv light action re-\par
sults in multiple lesions in the dna molecule and\par
leads to reactivation because\par
the deletions restore correct reading of the code\par
in a large part of dna molecule.\par
on the basis of this explanation reactivation of\par
chemically injured dna by means\par
of fusion and annealing with homologous but\par
genetically inactive dna, or by slight\par
fragmentation of dna by means of ultrasonic\par
vibrations may be expected.  attempts\par
to achieve reactivation by both methods gave\par
positive results.\par

lowing experimental data  dna isolated from\par

of competent b. subtilis cells.  ps 10 dna is\par
distinguishable from b. subtilis dna\par
by its higher density in a cs2so4 gradient and\par
its lower thermal denaturation\par

a temperature characteristic of b. subtilis dna\par
rather than of viral dna.  the\par
transforming activity of ps 10 dna bands in a\par

1209. the theory and practice of the family diagnostic.  ii. theoretical\par
aspects and resident education\par
family intervention and observation have proved\par
useful in 3 areas.  the 1st of these is observation of the\par
psychosocial context in the patient.  on admission to a\par
mental hospital the phenomenon of extrusion and separ-\par
ation from the family is evident, and the need for study\par
of the interaction between the patient and his family\par
milieu is vital.  the 2nd area where the family inter-\par
view has a major role is resident education.  the tra-\par
ditional medical education of the ill prepares the stu-\par
dent for consideration of the multifactorial problems of\par
emotional disorder in which balances between mem-\par
bers of a group may be the issue rather than external\par
pathogenes.  the family interview offers a unique point\par
of observation of factually evident and emotionally con-\par
vincing group data.  in addition to the observation of\par
family phenomena, mutual understanding of others'\par
problems is created.  finally, the family interview\par
serves as an instrument for data collection and hypo-\par
thesis seeking in relating individual psychopathology\par
to family adaptations.  the patient and his family at\par
the time of admission are dealing with a crisis.  some-\par
times this is traumatic, such as the unexpected loss\par
of a young marital partner, an unexpected illness, or\par
a financial reverse.  more commonly, however, it is\par
developmental being a natural part of the life cycle.\par
characteristically, the developmental task involved\par
in dealing with the crises has been postponed so that\par
one does not see the family at the age specific and ap-\par
propriate time for this task.  the crisis emerges dis-\par
ruptively because of inevitable biological maturation,\par
personal decision, or social expectation.  a primary\par
concern of the leader is to determine what life task is\par
being faced.  families have a mentally ill member not\par
merely because they are dealing with the vicissitudes\par
of life.  they are unable to cope with the crisis, be-\par
cause of the feelings which are aroused.  each life cri-\par
sis leads to a particular constellation of effects in any\par
given family.  these include primarily, sadness, anger,\par
and guilt, but there may well be specific affective con-\par
stellations appropriate to different developmental tasks.\par
the patient's inability to cope with a life crisis is due\par
to his particular adaptation of a style of dealing with\par
feelings that is employed by other members of the family.\par

for at least 3 mth., (5) less acting out\par
in the community, (6) neither disorientation\par
nor confusion on admission, (7) no\par
symptoms of depressive psychosis, (8) premor-\par
bid schizoid personality, (9) no clear\par
precipitating events, (10) no concern with dying\par

4854. on the formation of object-relations and identifications of the\par
kibbutz child\par
some of the issues relevant to the early\par
stages of object relation formation and\par
identification of kibbutz children are\par
discussed.  for this purpose the child rearing\par
milieu of the kibbutz child is described\par
and some clinical illustrations are given.\par
the relationship to the mother is seen\par
as the main object-relation and those to the\par
educators as transient-interchangeable\par
need-satisfying relationships.  on the basis\par
of retrospective analytical material it\par
appears that in the course of development\par
the two relations as well as the two\par
respective, originally distinct, object represen-\par
tations are synthetised into one.  the\par
conditions of communal education, character-\par
ised by double object-relation formation\par
from birth on, are seen as factors that in-\par
tensify the 'normative crisis of infancy',\par
especially the transition from the symbio-\par
tic to the separation-individuation stage\par
of object-relation development.\par

2953. the death of a parent\par
in the case of depressive illnesses the death\par
of either parent prior to the child reach-\par
ing the age of 15 seemed to be correlated\par
as a significant contributory factor.  with\par
this exception, statistical studies suggest\par
that it is the death of a mother in the first\par
7 yr. of a child's life, as opposed to that\par
of a father, that is potentially an etiologi-\par
cal factor for the future development of\par
psychoses, delinquency and psychoneuroses.\par
the case histories of 6 boys who had lost\par
their fathers were given.  in each instance\par
there was distinct evidence that the psychological\par
symptoms and behavioral disturb-\par
ances were to be attributed in large measure\par
to the effect of the death upon the child,\par
and that in some cases the symptom choice was\par
to be correlated with specific cir-\par
cumstances surrounding the death of the father.\par
in some cases it was the unresolved\par
grief reaction in the mother which helped to\par
perpetuate the disorder in the child.  re-\par
solution of this in the mother during therapy\par
led to improvement in the child's func-\par
tioning.  in other instances improvement\par
occurred especially when the child ceased\par
to be preoccupied with a close identification\par
with the dead father.  those boys who\par
were involved most closely in their mother's\par
grief reactions were the ones who were\par
most disturbed.  the brief treatment given\par
these boys and their mothers appeared\par
to be responsible for the considerable\par
amelioration of symptoms that resulted.  ther-\par
apeutic intervention is worthwhile,\par
especially in those instances where there is an\par
unresolved grief reaction in the mother.\par

1848. the child's concept of death\par
in this translation of a paper, which first\par
appeared in 1912, it is shown, according\par
to freud, how far a child's appreciation\par
of being dead differs from its true signifi-\par
cance.  death means a reversible decrease\par
in life functions, that can be interrupted\par
at any time, like sleep.  at other times it\par
may mean a temporary separation; but\par
always it is in man's power to change it.\par
in this concept, the child's unconscious\par
finds license for his sadism.  cruelty to\par
animals and death wishes against persons\par
close to him appear, in overcompensation, as\par
exaggerated pity for dead creatures\par
and the belief in man's power over life and death.\par

1849. mother child interaction during separation individuation\par
after a stage of normal autism during the\par
1st weeks of extrauterine life, the infant\par
passes into a symbiotic phase, gradually\par
emerging from this stage of dual unity at\par
the end of the 5th mth and during the 6th\par
mth.  just before this, the next phase\par
separation individuation begins.  four\par
characteristic subphases of this separation\par
individuation process are described\par
differentiation, the practicing period, association\par
and a stage, characterized by unfolding\par
of complex cognitive functions.  the relation\par
of mother and child throughout these\par
subphases are studied and illustrated by clinical\par
material.  a poor relation between mother\par
and child in 1 subphase does not necessarily\par
or usually preclude impressive changes\par
for the better in the next subphase.\par

as well as the probability of subjection\par
to frightening and painful procedures.\par

the resultant stress, behavioral\par

2906. early childhood separations\par
every child in this long-term study of child\par
rearing showed significant reactions to\par
ordinary separations by about 1 yr. of age.\par
the similar pattern of response in this\par
group of children suggests a biologically\par
determined cause.  the clinging reaction\par
appeared when the child became mobile and\par
able to move away from his mother re-\par
gardless of the frequency or duration of his\par
separations.  the majority of the mothers\par
did not understand this natural phenomenon\par
and regarded the clinging and crying of\par
the 1-year-old as evidence of spoiled or\par
regressed behavior.  the pediatrician can\par
be helpful to a mother by anticipating and\par
explaining separation responses, by indi-\par
cating their universality, and by giving\par
specific recommendations for gradual changes\par
to modify these reactions.\par

separation.\par
developmental scales were\par
administered to 2 groups of infants during and sub-\par
sequent to a temporary period of institutionalization.\par
although both groups experienced maternal separa-\par
tion, only 1 group was subjected to deprivation, in\par
that it received very much less stimulation than the\par
other.  results from a longitudinal testing program\par
show that the scores of the deprived group during\par
the period of separation were significantly lower than\par
those of the nondeprived group, no progressive de-\par
terioration of scores took place in the course of\par
institutionalization, immediately following return\par
home, while the scores of the nondeprived group re-\par
mained constant, those of the deprived infants jumped\par
to the level of the other group.  3 theories regarding\par
the mechanism underlying the association between\par
deprivation and developmental retardation are exam-\par
ined and it is suggested that an explanation in moti-\par
vational terms best fits the results obtained.\par

1808. separation anxiety  a factor in the object relations of\par
schizophrenic patients.\par
the thesis is advanced that\par
special vulnerability to separation anxiety is a crucial\par
factor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishing\par
and maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships.\par
2 major reasons for this are lack of autonomy and lack\par
of object constancy.  without a stable autonomous\par
capacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi-\par
nately dependent upon others for help, protection, and\par
direction.  without object constancy, he is unable to\par
maintain a stable representation of the needed person in\par
the latter's absence.  evidence is presented from the\par
intensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients.\par
many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation-\par
ship center about the patient's separation anxiety and\par
his attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging,\par
perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to deny\par
separation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi-\par
nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reverse\par
passive victimization into active mastery.  the practical\par
implications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz-\par
ophrenic patients are discussed.\par

in this study.  the frequency of visits to the dis-\par
pensary for symptomatic complaints was not signifi-\par
cantly higher among those who reported separation\par
than among those who did not.  the data suggest\par
that an apparent association between relatively high\par

experience may be understandable in terms of a cause-\par

1463. investigations of lens protein and microelectrophoresis of\par
hydrosoluble protein in senile cataract\par
the investigations on lens protein and\par
on agar-microelectrophoresis of hydro-\par
soluble protein in normal lenses and in those affected with senile cataract re-\par
vealed the following facts  (1) in opaque\par
lenses, a diminution of the total protein\par
and the soluble protein takes place, as\par
well as an increase in the amount of in-\par
soluble protein.  the decrease in the\par
quantity of soluble protein is higher than the\par
increase of insoluble protein which does\par
not only point to a transformation of the\par
soluble protein into the insoluble variety,\par
but also to the disappearance of a protein\par
fraction from the lens.  changes in the\par
quantity of soluble protein are accompanied\par
by the decrease of protein in slow fractions\par
of the electropherogram and even by\par
the disappearance of these fractions and\par
the increase of the amount of protein in\par
fractions of medium velocity.  with the\par
development of cataract and the mature\par
phase of cataract, all these processes\par
become more and more distinct.  in this\par
respect, a strong parallelism exists between\par
the protein changes and the clinical\par
picture of senile cataract.  (2) qualitative\par
and quantitative changes which occur in\par
the protein of normal lenses with advancing\par
age show a character similar to those\par
in senile cataract, however, they are less\par
pronounced.  in this instance, the de-\par
crease in the quantity of soluble protein is\par
likewise closely associated with the\par
diminution of the protein content in the slow\par
fractions of the electropherogram.\par
(3) the changes in the soluble protein content\par
of the lens and the alterations of\par
the protein amounts in the slow fractions which\par
always accompany the former,\par
play the principal role in the aging process\par
of the lens and in the development of\par
senile cataract.  (4) the investigations\par
seem to indicate that the aging processes,\par
of lenses as well as the development of\par
senile cataract are of a similar character,\par
but of different intensity.  (5) undoubtedly,\par
the processes of transition from slow\par
fractions of soluble protein into faster ones\par
and the transformation of part of the\par
soluble protein into insoluble protein which is\par
likely to be associated with these\par
processes as well as the partial disappearance\par
of total protein from the lens seem\par
to play a very important part in the mechanisms\par
pertaining to the development\par
of cataract.\par

their molecular weights, n-terminal amino\par
acid sequences and antigenic structures\par
were all similar, but their amino acid\par
compositions and the sulphydryl groups con-\par
tained showed certain dissimilarities.  it\par
is probable that the 4 proteins possess\par
small differences in their primary structure,\par
which are not associated with the\par
antigenic sites and which may have arisen\par
from mutations during evolution.\par

3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-\par
nation\par
earlier investigations have shown that, in\par
the presence of high concentrations of\par
urea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is split\par
into a number of subunits with apparent-\par
ly different electrophoretic mobilities but\par
similar molecular weights.  the recom-\par
bination of these subunits after removal of\par
the urea has been studied by ultracentri-\par
fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.\par
it was found that maximal recombina-\par
tion was obtained when the ionic strength\par
during the removal of the urea was high\par
(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths a\par
molecule with only half the molecular weight\par
of native a-crystallin and a much lower\par
sedimentation coefficient was obtained.  a\par
complete recovery of the structure of\par
native a-crystallin was never obtained, even\par
at high ionic strengths, as was evident\par
from electrophoretic and quantitative preci-\par
pitin analyses.  the subunits were\par
fractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu-\par
lose in the presence of 7 m urea.\par
the purification was followed by polyacrylamide-\par
gel electrophoresis.  after removal of\par
the urea at high ionic strength, 2 of the\par
fractions obtained showed reactions of\par
only partial identity with native a-crystallin\par
in immunodiffusion tests, but all other\par
fractions showed complete identity.  the\par
differences in the electrophoretic\par
mobilities of the fractions in the presence of\par
urea persisted after removal of the urea.\par
all fractions had much higher sedimen-\par
tation coefficients in the absence of urea\par
than in its presence, although the values\par
for urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallin\par
obtained after removal of the urea\par
were not reached even at high ionic strengths.\par
the amino acid composition of the\par
fractions was found to differ.  these\par
observations suggest that a-crystallin is com-\par
posed of a number of chemically different,\par
but related, subunits of approximately\par
the same size, which are bound together\par
by nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos-\par
sibly hydrophobic bonds.  moreover,\par
when isolated, these subunits have the ability\par
to associate and form molecules of\par
high molecular weight.\par

4 fractions by subsequent gel filtration on\par

coefficients of which were 13.6, 9.6, 4.9 and\par

however, all 4 fractions contained some\par
additional minor components, as revealed\par

195. properties of a cold-precipitable protein fraction in the\par
lens\par
a soluble protein fraction which precipitates\par
in aqueous solutions at temperatures\par
below 10  c has been isolated from the rat\par
lens.  this fraction appears to be re-\par
sponsible for the reversible 'cold cataract'\par
which has been seen to develop when\par
young mammals are exposed to temperatures\par
below 10  c.  as the rat ages, the\par
concentration of this protein fraction\par
decreases, but the fraction does not com-\par
pletely disappear, even from the lenses\par
of 3-year-old rats.  although the molecular\par
species comprising this fraction appear to\par
be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge,\par
disc electrophoresis and immunodiffusion\par
have shown that they are a heterogeneous\par
mixture of a-, b- and y-crystallin subunits.\par
the ability of the cold-precipitable\par
protein (ccp) fraction to precipitate in the\par
cold depends upon its concentration and\par
the ionic strength and ph of the solvent.  in\par
solutions of ph 4.0, some aggregation\par
of the 4 s cpp occurs to form a 17 s component,\par
which no longer precipitates in\par
the cold.  the ability of this protein fraction to\par
precipitate in the cold may depend\par
on hydrophobic bonding and its influence on the\par
conformation of the protein.\par

other reagents such as hcl, naoh, reduced\par

electrophoretic mobility as a-crystallin,\par

the amino acid composition is in\par
agreement with that reported for a-crystallin\par
prepared by a different method.  there\par
is one thiol group/20,000g. of protein\par

unit molecular weight), and disulphide\par
bonds are absent.  the thiol group has been\par
alkylated with radioactive iodoacetate\par
in the presence of urea.  partial acid hydroly-\par
sis of the alkylated protein gives,\par
according to the conditions, mainly 3 radioactive\par
peptides or nearly exclusively one\par
radioactive dipeptide.  the dipeptide is n-seryl-\par
(s-carboxymethyl) cysteine, ser-cmcys.\par
the 2 other peptides are probably the tri-\par
peptides related to ser-cmcys.  the\par
simplest interpretation of these results is that\par
the sequence around the cysteine residue\par

these preparations were treated with\par

submitted to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide\par
gels containing either urea or sodium\par

three bands were observed in 1% sodium dodecyl\par
sulphate.  on the other hand, the\par
sedimentation coefficient had the same value in both\par

urea-treated samples had the same concentration\par
of n-terminal glutamic acid whereas\par
the concentration of the 'trace' end-groups did\par
not change.  sedimentation-diffusion\par
equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge\par

the soluble proteins of bovine lenses were\par

acetate in the buffer was found\par
to be essential for achieving a good separation\par

fractions - a, b, c and d.  ultracentrifugal,\par
electrophoretic and immunochemical\par
analyses were used to compare these fractions\par

with a-crystallin, fractions b and c with\par
b-crystallin and fraction d with y-crystallin.\par

1745. the deaggregation of bovine lens a-crystallin\par
sedimentation equilibrium studies of lens\par
a-crystallin at neutral ph indicate that\par
this material is composed of a number\par
of different sized species.  a study of the\par
effect of alkali upon a-crystallin indicates\par
a progressive deaggregation of the ma-\par
terial with increasing ph.  sedimentation\par
equilibrium studies were performed at ph\par
12.8 as well as in guanidine hydrochloride,\par
7 m urea, and with succinylated material.\par
under all of these conditions a molecular\par
heterogeneity was observed.  the data\par
indicate that independent species coexisted\par
under most dissociating conditions.  the\par
weight average molecular weights of the\par
succinylated, and of the alkali-, urea-,\par
and guanidine hydrochloride-treated\par
material were found to have an integral relation-\par
ship of 8 4 2 1, respectively.  since a\par
constant ratio of m2 mw was found, it was\par
concluded that the same spread of\par
distribution of molecular species occurred for\par
each of the deaggregating conditions.\par
the results in guanidine hydrochloride could\par
not be evaluated in this manner because\par
of a small concentration dependence.  these\par
conclusions imply that not only the\par
weight average molecular weight in 7 m urea\par
but the actual molecular weight of\par
each individual species in urea was one-half of\par
the value to be found in alkali and\par
one-quarter that of the succinylated material.\par

1747. the problem of albuminoid\par
albuminoid is the main constituent of the\par
insoluble fraction of the lens proteins.\par
albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens has\par
been fractionated on deae-cellulose in\par
7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractions\par
are very similar to those from the corre-\par
sponding fractions from a-crystallin.\par
albuminoid can be regarded as an insoluble\par
a-crystallin.  an undiluted ground lens\par
is clear but becomes turbid on dilution.  if\par
albuminoid is present in the normal lens,\par
it does not cause turbidity even when the\par
cellular structure is disrupted.  it is\par
perhaps more likely that the albuminoid is\par
formed on dilution of the lens mush.\par
the high concentration of proteins in the lens,\par
especially in the nucleus, entails a high\par
degree of order, which will be destroyed\par
on dilution  this phenomenon may well be\par

normal and x-irradiated rat eyes\par
cell proliferation and migration in\par
the lens epithelium of normal and x-irradiated\par
rat eyes were studied by means of\par
autoradiography after labelling with tritiated\par
thymidine.  cells of the normal lens\par
epithelium require 16 hr. to pass from the\par
beginning of the synthesizing period\par
to the completion of mitosis.  this interval is\par
partitioned as follows  s period,\par
approximately 10 hr.; g2, slightly less than 5 hr;\par
and mitosis, 72 min.  following division,\par
labelled daughter cells migrate from the\par
germinative zone to the postequatorial\par
rows, and by 2 weeks after tracer injection\par
many radioactive nuclei are found in the\par
lens bow.  epithelial cells irradiated while\par
in the dna synthesis phase undergo\par
degeneration beginning approximately 8\par
hr. after exposure.  the onset of cell death\par
corresponds to the time at which these cells\par
would normally be preparing for mitosis\par
indicating that they die in abortive divisions.\par
a small percentage of the originally\par
labelled cells survived until 3 days after irradi-\par
ation, but by 2 weeks this number fell\par
almost to zero.  the loss of radioactive cells\par
occurred most rapidly in the equatorial zone.\par

migration\par
in the earliest stages of chicken lens\par
development, cell division occurred over the\par
entire lens.  cell division first stopped\par
in the posterior side of the lens vesicle, as\par
the cells differentiated into primary lens\par
fibers.  after the annular pad developed,\par
cell division occurred, for the most part,\par
in the anterior surface epithelial cells.\par
shortly after hatching and thereafter, a\par
germinative zone, consisting of a narrow\par
band of epithelial cells adjacent to the\par
annular pad developed.  the cells from the\par
germinative zone migrated slowly and\par
differentiated first into annular pad cells and\par
then into lens cortex fibers over an\par
estimated 2-year period.  this slow migration\par
of cells in the lens is discussed in\par
relation to the failure of the adult chicken to de-\par
velop radiation cataracts.\par

the fact that fish flour was shown to be a rich source of\par
dietary selenium (169 p.p.m. may have important implications (i.e. deleterious\par
effect on teeth) in the treatment and prevention of protein malnutrition.  it\par

1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity of\par
tocopherols\par
dietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effect\par
upon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimental\par
at higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness of\par
vitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increases\par
the retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has been\par
shown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing the\par
activities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in various\par
fractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and in\par
combination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other very\par
closely in the serum proteins.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may be\par
carried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus,\par
one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containing\par
compound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function in\par
absorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer across\par
cell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activity\par
in the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.\par

experiments were performed on wistar rats weighing 150-200 g.  thallium was ad-\par

given per os in doses of 10 mg/kg 2 hr after poisoning and 5 mg/kg daily\par
for the next 2 days.  results indicate that sodium selenate protects the\par
animals from death.  it binds the thallium ions and increases their deposition\par
in organs.  comparison of the level of thallium in organs of treated rats\par
shows that selenate increases in liver by 290.6%, in kidneys by 326.8% and in\par
bones by 210.0%.  no influence of selenate on excretion of thallium in the\par
urine was found, but fecal excretion of thallium increased by an average of\par

2281. inhibition of active transport of sugars through rat intestine in vitro.\par
ii. action of mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite\par
it is shown that mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite, which had been regarded\par
as inhibitors of intestinal absorption of glucose, are inhibitors of active\par
transport of sugars in sacs of everted jejunum of rat (wilson and wiseman's\par
method).  mepacrine 5 x 10 -3 m and 10 -2 m inhibit, by 85% and 100%\par
respectively, the active transport of galactose.  with atractyloside 10 -5 m\par
and 10 -3 m, the inhibitions were 77% and 100% and, with selenite 10 -4 m and\par
10 -3 m, about 70%.  in general the inhibitors are effective within orders of\par
magnitude which are similar in vivo and in vitro.  atractyloside is rather more\par
effective in vitro than in vivo, and mepacrine rather less.  it is easier to\par
achieve total inhibitions of the active transport of sugars in vitro than of\par
intestinal absorption from isotonic solutions in vivo.\par

2284. analogs parasympathetic neuroeffectors.  ii. comparative pharmacological\par
studies of acetylcholine, its thio and seleno analogs, and their hydrolysis\par
products\par
acetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine exert acetylcholine-like effects on\par
the guinea-pig ileum and frog rectus abdominis preparations.  with the\par
latter preparation, responses to acetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine,\par
in contrast to that to acetylcholine, are not enhanced by the addition of an\par
anticholinesterase.  this is attributable to the relatively high activity of\par
the hydrolysis products, cholinethiol and cholineselenol; acetylthiocholine\par
and acetyselenocholine undergo enzymatic hydrolysis at approximately the same\par
rate as does acetylcholine.  the hydrolysis products of acetylthiocholine and\par
acetylselenocholine, which have effects on the guinea-pig ileum comparable\par
to those of the parent esters, are readily oxidized in air to the relatively\par
inactive choline disulfide and choline diselenide, respectively.  these\par
observations are helpful in explaining many of the apparently contradictory\par
statements in the literature regarding the actions of acetylthiocholine.\par

chronic poisoning with na selenite (in the drinking water) causes hepatic\par
cirrhosis, usually of atrophic type, in rats.  in rabbits there seems to be a\par
definite diabetogenic action, while attempts to demonstrate such action in\par
dogs have so far given inconclusive results.  the difference between these\par
2 species is perhaps due to the technique used (different spacing of injections\par
for practical reasons).  the action of selenite on the pancreas is discussed\par
and it is pointed out that se can replace s in sh groups, thus rendering the\par
latter ineffective.  both in effects on the liver and in those on the pancreas\par

selenium toxicosis.  the most severe and consistent pathologic changes were\par
found in the myocardium and lungs.  myocardial alterations were focal to\par
diffuse degeneration, necrosis and early replacement fibrosis.  pulmonary\par
changes, consisting of edema and interstitial hemorrhages, were typical of the\par
degenerative processes which characterize passive congestion of the lungs\par
resulting from left ventricular insufficiency.  atrophy of lymphoid centers\par

2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animals\par
the article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of available\par
information on selenium toxicity in domestic animals.  literature reveals\par
evidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when given\par
orally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts.  there is also variation\par
in toxicity of organic se analogs.  when exposed to ruminal digestion, there is\par
considerable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactive\par
elemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as much\par
as 40% of a single oral dose.  fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium,\par
cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity.  arsenic and\par
tungsten give some protection against it.  bromobenzene, benzene, and\par
napthalene\par
mobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion.  since se preparations designed\par
for topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available for\par
use\par
in both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning from\par
misuse\par
of such preparations.  selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeutic\par
agent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic.\par
however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritional\par
and toxic doses of these salts.\par

resistance could also be induced by\par

the efficacy of anaphylactic tests in detecting\par

study was carried out using rat tissue\par

acting as a mock cancer antigen.  it\par
was found that if byg (absolute dosage 100\par
ug.) had formed 1/6 of the antigen mix-\par
ture used for sensitization it was readily\par
detected when present in a concentration\par
of 10-3 in the serum used for challenge,\par
but not invariably detected in a concentra-\par
tion of 10-4.  if byg (absolute dosage 50\par
ug.) had formed approximately 1/50 of the\par
sensitizing mixture, it was infrequently\par
detected even when present in the challeng-\par
ing serum in a concentration of 10-2.  it\par

phocytes was specific to the particular tumor used for\par

krebs ii mouse ascites-tumor cells infected\par
with encephalomyocarditis virus were\par
found to contain, in addition to mature virus,\par
a virus-specific protein antigen.  an\par
assay, based on the ability of this antigen\par
to block the neutralization of purified virus\par
by its specific antiserum, was developed.\par
this antigen was present both in the cul-\par
ture fluid 17 hr. after the infection of cells\par
with virus and intracellularly, where its\par
titer increased at a time when viral capsid\par
protein was being synthesized.  within the\par
cell, it was mostly localized in the soluble\par
cell sap.  in contrast with virus, the anti-\par
gen did not agglutinate sheep erythrocytes,\par
and its immunological properties were\par
destroyed by digestion with trypsin.  ribonucleic\par
acid was not detected in concentrat-\par
ed preparations of the antigen, nor was the titer\par
of antigen affected by ribonuclease.\par
the antigen had a sedimentation coefficient (20 )\par
of approx. 14s, and its diffusion co-\par
efficient, determined by the method of allison and\par
humphrey (1960), was 3.2 x 10-7\par
sq. cm. sec.-1.  the particle weight of the antigen\par
was hence 420,000   40,000.  the\par
capsid protein from purified encephalomyocarditis\par
virus could be degraded by treat-\par
ment with ethanolamine into a protein of sedimentation\par
coefficient (20 ) of approx.\par
4s.  the 14s antigen, when similarly treated, yielded\par
a protein of similar size.  however,\par
no such smaller antigen was detected in virus-infected\par
cells.  it is concluded that the\par
non-hemagglutinating antigen represents a polymeric\par
form of the basic viral capsid-\par
protein molecule and that it is synthesized in the\par
cytoplasm of infected cells.  it may\par
be either an intermediate or a by-product in the\par
process of viral capsid-protein syn-\par

barriers of the h-2 system\par
sublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibility\par
barriers have been derived\par
from strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passage\par
through newborn hosts of a\par
foreign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2\par
incompatible recipients pretreated\par
with isoantisera directed against the tumor cells.\par
the nonspecific character induced\par
by these procedures was usually expressed in a\par
number of different h-2 incompa-\par
tible recipients.  the changes responsible for\par
the conversion to nonspecific growth\par
appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion.\par
expression of the nonspecific character\par
required exposure to the foreign host environment\par
for more than 30 days.  at this\par
stage and during the subsequent 3 transfer\par
generations, reversion to strain-specific\par
growth occurred on back-transfer to the\par
strain of origin; after 4 passages in the\par
foreign hosts the nonspecific character was\par
permanently established, however, and\par
could not be reverted by prolonged passage\par
in the original host genotype.  the\par
growth rate of strain-specific tumors and\par
their nonspecific sublines was compared\par
in the strain of origin.  no difference was\par
found with one tumor, while the strain-\par
specific line grew better than the nonspecific\par
sublines with another.  this difference\par
was detected in the homozygous strain of\par
origin and in different semi-isologous f1\par
hybrids.  all lines grew better in the\par
homozygous strain than in the f1 hybrids,\par
however.  a comparison was made\par
between the concentration of h-2 isoantigenic\par
surface determinants in strain-specific\par
tumors and their nonspecific sublines by a\par
quantitative absorption technique in\par
vitro.  all nonspecific sublines had a lower\par
concentration of h-2 isoantigens than\par
the strain-specific tumors.  this suggests\par
that nonspecific tumors develop as a result\par
of immunoselection of variants resistant\par
to the homograft reaction and are characterized\par
by a lowered concentration of\par
h-2 antigens.\par

specific antigens have been demonstrated\par

immunized.  the animals were bled to death\par
10 days after the last injection.  testing\par
included fluorescent antibody methods and\par
agar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitin\par
test.  the pattern of reaction of these\par
antibodies against various cancers seems to\par
be dependent upon the source of the\par
cancerous dna-bound proteins and the salt\par
concentration used in their isolation.\par
human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigens\par
seem to be cross reacting rather\par
than identical in structure.  the cancer-specific\par
antibodies could be removed only\par
with absorption of the immune globulins with\par
cancerous tissues.  salt-soluble human\par
dna-bound proteins from an adenocarcinoma\par
of the colon and an ewing's sarcoma\par
induced the formation of cancer specific\par
antibodies which showed positive fta re-\par
actions (to a maximum titer of 1/128) against\par
95% of the cancerous tissues studied.\par
these cancer-specific antibodies gave\par
similar fta reactions with cell nuclei of\par

adjacent to metastatic carcinoma of colon, nor-\par
mal appearing colon near to metastatic\par
carcinoma of the colon, normal appearing\par
colon near to carcinoma of the colon,\par
and a long-standing case of chronic ulcerative\par
colitis.  evidence is shown that this finding\par
possibly may represent a serological\par
detection of an early or latent cancerous\par
change in morphologically normal cells.\par
these cancer-specific antigens have been\par
identified as rounded, intranuclear dna-\par

266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigens\par
after a broad historical survey of immunological\par
studies of cancer, a review is given\par
of the evidence showing that antigens present in\par
normal cells are missing from the\par
malignant cells that arise from the same tissue.\par
this evidence is considered in con-\par
junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,\par
and the author emphasizes,\par
that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesis\par
is enzymatic deletion.  antigenic\par
gain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,\par
chemical, and viral carcino-\par
genesis is reviewed, together with experiments\par
demonstrating the existence of\par
tumour-specific antigens.  the question is then\par
posed: if tumours have specific anti-\par
gens, why is evidence for their rejection so scanty?\par
the occasional spontaneous re-\par
gression points to host resistance but its rarity\par
suggests that tolerance generally\par
develops.  consideration is given to the\par
application of immunological methods to\par
therapy and although current achievement\par
in this field is limited, new immunological\par
stratagems might yet transform the picture.\par
finally a plea is made for the integra-\par
tion of the disciplines of immunology and\par
cellular differentiation.  the prospect is\par
raised that through a synthetic and holistic\par
approach we might discover the suscepti-\par
bility of the cancer cell to re-differentiation\par
and re-recognition.\par

the study of osteoporosis\par

radiological evidence strongly suggests that\par
osteoporosis (with the possible exception of acute\par

sible condition.  the changes therefore to be\par
expected in calcium balance when an osteoporotic\par
is treated are small compared with those often\par
seen in osteomalacia.  methods of obtaining more\par
accurate calcium balances are needed to show\par
these small changes, especially when a high\par
calcium intake is used.  the method of continuous\par
marking of stools with chromium sesquioxide\par
seems to provide just such a method.  using this\par
method, it has so far proved impossible to obtain\par
prolonged large positive calcium balances in\par

the aetiology and treatment of\par
urinary calculus\par
investigations in this laboratory have been\par
based on the hypothesis that calculus formation is\par
primarily a process of crystallization from super-\par
saturated solutions rather than one of adsorption\par
on a specific protein matrix, as has been postulated\par
by boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,\par
1963).  that crystallization is the primary factor\par
is strongly suggested by the recent studies of\par
vermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authors\par
produced artificial concretions which closely\par
resembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotating\par
wire loop in normal urine for several days and\par
slowly adding the appropriate stone-forming\par
elements.\par
if the above hypothesis is correct then the\par
factors of primary interest in urinary stone\par
formation are those responsible for supersaturation,\par
nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remains\par
to be learnt about these various factors, their\par
inter-relationships, and their relative importance.\par
the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins,\par
muco-proteins and polysaccharides) in calculus\par
formation is still not clear but it is probable that\par
they play an important secondary role in binding\par
crystalline precipitates to form a non-friable\par
calculus.  since time is an important factor in\par
crystal growth such non-specific binding by\par
proteins would increase the chances of stone\par
growth and retention within the upper urinary\par
tract.\par

to have some urinary-calcium-lowering effect.  finally, a\par

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitro\par
on mitochondrial metabolism\par
it is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, several\par
non-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, ion\par
transport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.\par
thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biological\par
actions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.\par
rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroid\par
extracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrial\par
transport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this protein\par
might be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-\par
thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in view\par
of the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  all\par
of our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroid\par
proteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,\par
or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.\par
further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determine\par
whether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validly\par
reflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is sound\par
to use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.\par

g. b. fasolo, r. malvano, u. rosa and e. zimmer\par
interstitial b-therapy, by implantation in tissues of\par
radioactive sources, is widely applied to the treatment\par
of certain forms of human malignancies.  among the\par
radio-elements proposed for this therapeutic technique,\par
yttrium-90 and gold-198 are the most generally used.\par
radiophosphorus (32p) shows some attractive features\par
because of its suitable half-life (14.3 days) and its rather\par
high-energy b-emission (maximum energy 1.71 mev);\par
but the use of this radionuclide is limited by the diffi-\par
culties found in the preparation of safe solid sources.  the\par
only techniques we have found in the literature are those\par
reported by riechert and mundinger and by rames and\par
moravek, who used respectively small plastic capsules\par
filled with phosphomolybdic acid solution, and ca(po4),\par
grains, labelled with phosphorus-32.  these methods\par
require a delicate preparative work, and, moreover, a\par
large b-self-absorption effect can be expected in both\par
cases.\par
a new simple method for the preparation of grains\par
labelled with phosphorus-32 basically consists in ad-\par
sorbing labelled po4 3- ions on an active aluminium oxide\par
film produced by anodic oxidation of aluminium wire.\par
the adsorption capacity of the oxide film for po3 3- ions\par
is quite high, but the process is reversible: the phos-\par
phorus-32 activity is partially desorbed, even after\par
'sealing' in boiling water, when the labelled wire is kept\par

ferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) induces\par
selective calcification in the buccal mucosa,\par

fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcification\par
normally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-\par
roidectomy protects the nephrectomized rat\par
against the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.\par
hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologous\par

glucose tolerance tests, conn (3) and\par
comparini (9) observed a lowered rate of\par
glucose utilization in febrile subjects.\par
malizia (10) found an accentuated rate\par
of decline of serum phosphorus during\par
glucose tolerance tests in subjects with\par
high temperatures, but the glycemic\par
responses did not differ from those ob-\par
tained when controls without fever were\par
subjected to the same tests.  whether it\par
be for utilization purposes or not, the\par
fact remains that a massive transfer of\par
phosphorus from the serum into the\par
tissues takes place in fever.\par

relationship of maximal tubular phosphate\par

a maximal renal tubular rate of reabsorption of phos-\par

the dog, as in the man, considerable variability in the tmp\par
often occurs.  while some of this variability remains unex-\par
plained, a direct relationship between glomerular filtration\par
rate (gfr) and tmp can be demonstrated when the gfr is\par
varied over a wide range.  this relationship suggests that\par
glomerular intermittency may exist in the dog.\par

human growth hormone\par
clinical measurement, response to hypoglycemia and suppression by\par

a standard test of growth-hormone secretory ca-\par
pacity, based on radioimmunoassay of plasma growth\par
hormone after insulin hypoglycemia, is described.  in\par
normal subjects a standard insulin tolerance test, caus-\par
ing an average blood glucose drop to 34 per cent of\par

mone to 45.2 millimicrogm. per milliliter at one hour,\par
with a total range of 25 to 70 millimicrogm. per mil-\par
liliter.  no response was observed in 5 hypopituitary\par
subjects.\par
under comparable hypoglycemic stimulation glu-\par
cocorticoid-treated patients showed a marked in-\par
hibition of the growth-hormone response, which was\par
related to dose.  subjects receiving more than 60\par
mg. of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean plasma\par
rise to 6.7 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 1.5\par

hypophysectomy, replacement therapy, and the tolerance of the\par
euryhaline killifish, fundulus heteroclitus, to hypotonic media\par
hypophysectomized fundulus heteroclitus, as previously reported, survive only a\par
few days after transfer from salt to fresh water.  survival time is the same\par
when fish are tested 2 weeks or 2 months after hypophysectomy.  gradual\par
dilution of the external medium produces failure at an average salinity of\par
0.26% (0.67-0.02%).  this salinity is comparable to that causing failure after\par
abrupt transfer.  although failure is associated with hypochloremia, daily\par
injections of a balanced salt solution or 0.6% nacl shorten survival.\par
daily injections of teleostean neurohypophysial peptides, arginine vasotocin\par
(2.25 and 0.0225 pressor mu per gram) and isotocin (1.32 and 0.026 oxytocic mu\par
per gram) do not prolong survival.  an extract of caudal neurosecretory tissue\par
(urophysis) from male tilapia mossambica had no beneficial action at doses of\par
50 ug per gram every other day.  purified ovine prolactin.  105 mu per gram on\par
alternate days, maintained survival of 10 of 11 fish for the duration of the\par
28-day test period in fresh water, irrespective of the period of pretreatment\par
in salt water.  purified bovine prolactin prolonged survival and 2 of 6 fish\par
were maintained for 28 days.  purified bovine growth hormone was ineffective.\par
monkey growth hormone containing 2 u per milligram of prolactin activity,\par
administered at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to 40 mu per gram\par
prolactin activity), prolonged survival.  human growth hormone containing 4 u\par
per milligram of prolactin activity, at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to\par
80 ml per gram prolactin activity) also prolonged survival and 4 of 6 fish\par
were maintained for 28 days.\par
the ability of pituitary preparations to protect hypophysectomized\par
f. heteroclitus from failure in fresh water appears to be related to their\par
prolactin activity and not to their content of neurohypophysial peptides.\par
this suggests that an adenohypophysial hormone resembling mammalian prolactin\par
is essential for survival of this fish in hypotonic external media.  carp\par
pituitary preparations do not protect hypophysectomized f. heteroclitus\par
although f. heteroclitus pituitaries are known to be effective.\par

thirteen pituitary dwarfs have\par

at a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.\par
thereafter, despite larger doses of growth\par
hormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to\par
0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persisted\par
after stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2\par
occasions, acceleration of growth did not\par
occur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in her\par
serum before treatment, were repeatedly\par
demonstrated in her serum in high concentra-\par

during treatment.  comparable titers of anti-\par
body have not been found in any of the 12\par
other patients receiving long-term hgh treat-\par
ment.  the specificity of the human anti-hgh\par
serum differed from rabbit anti-hgh serum.\par
whereas both monkey growth hormone\par
(mgh) and hgh were effective inhibitors of\par
the binding of hgh-131i by rabbit antiserum,\par
only hgh was an effective inhibitor with\par

homog-\par
enates of adenophypophysial tissue obtained from alloxan-\par
injected adult male rats varying in duration and severity of\par
diabetes, as well as from diabetic rats maintained on an\par
insulin replacement regimen, were assayed in immature\par
hypophysectomized female rats.  the ability of these crude\par
hypophysial extracts to encourage tibial cartilage width ex-\par
pansion gain in body weight, and to depress hematocrit and\par
blood area levels was determined.  significant decrements in\par
ability to increase epiphysial cartilage width and ability to\par
depress hematocrits were noted 14 to 28 days following injection\par
of alloxan.  increasing the intensity of the diabetic state was\par
associated with decreased growth-promoting potency of hypo-\par
physial preparations as well as with decreased ability to\par
influence the hematological indices.  hypophysial extracts taken\par
from insulin-treated diabetic rats contained more growth\par
hormone than equivalent amounts of tissue obtained from\par
control rats.  it is concluded that the adenohypophyses of\par
diabetic rats contain diminished amounts of growth hormone\par
and the insulin repairs or encourages greater than normal ac-\par

a heretofore unreported association of defects, namely hypoglycemia, growth\par

1-year-old child is described.  human growth hormone (hgh), 3 mg. a day for 7\par
days, doubled the fasting blood sugar, prevented the postprandial hypoglycemia,\par
and reversed the sensitivity to tolbutamide and leucine.  treatment with 1\par
mg. of hgh 3 times a week produced a growth of 7 inches in 3 months compared to a\par
growth of 1 inch in the previous 13 months.  since the protein-bound-iodine and\par
the response to methopyrapone were normal and the blood level of growth hormone\par
was low, this case is presented as a probable isolated growth hormone\par
deficiency.\par

the actions of the hormone by inhibition or destruction.  we shall deal with a\par

growth and growth retardation\par
various attempts have been made over the years to define growth.  from\par
the standpoint of this review, growth is the physiological accretion of new\par
tissue which is reflected in the acquisition of protein and water.  this\par
process in almost all instances leads to increase in size (length, weight, and\par
volume) and actively progresses from the fertilization of the ovum to the\par
period of sexual maturity where millions of cells are present in a state of\par
advanced organization.  with further time, growth is less and, indeed, may\par
become negative insofar as cells are lost.\par

the availability of a sensitive assay for human growth hormone has made\par
it possible to directly measure the effects of various agents purported to\par
alter growth patterns.  acromegalic patients present a special problem both in\par
early diagnosis and in therapy.  being able to measure growth hormone in\par
these patients provides an accurate index of activity and a precise measure\par
of therapeutic effectiveness.\par
in an attempt to determine whether a pituitary block of growth hormone\par
secretion is feasible in this condition, a study was made of the effects of\par
estrogen, androgen and glucocorticoid administration on growth hormone\par
response to a standard insulin tolerance test in a patient with active acro-\par

suppress either basal growth hormone secretion or blunt its responsiveness\par

of its complement of corticotropin.\par
treatment of two dwarfs with practical growth\par
hormone in aqueous solution, 1 or 2 mg intra-\par
muscularly on alternate days, accelerated the\par

the response of normal adipose\par

hypophysectomized rats with crude, whole\par

tion of epinephrine to normal.  posterior pi-\par
tuitary extract and corticotropin replacement\par
was without effect.  thyrotropin injections\par
produced a partial, and growth hormone\par
treatment a full restoration of the lipolytic\par
action of epinephrine.  treatment of hypo-\par
physectomized rats with cortisol or cortico-\par

adipose tissue to epinephrine, but only when\par
relatively large doses of these hormones were\par
given.  physiological doses of triiodothyronine\par
(1 ug/rat/day), however, restored the nor-\par

growth hormone.  following administration of the labeled\par
hormone to animals, the label appeared to remain attached to\par
the growth hormone molecule for at least 4 hours.  administra-\par
tion of the labeled hormone promoted growth in hypophysec-\par
tomized rats and increased the free fatty acid concentration\par
in rabbit serum to a degree comparable with that seen following\par
administration of unlabeled growth hormone.  rabbit anti-\par
bovine growth hormone serum neutralized the rat growth\par

growth hormone\par
growth hormone influences protein, fat,\par
carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  it\par
promotes nitrogen retention, growth of\par
cartilage, transportation of amino acids\par
through the cell wall, and incorporation of\par
amino acids into protein.  this factor mo-\par
bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissue\par
and increases the serum concentration of\par
these substances; long-term administration\par
of this hormone is followed by depletion of\par
body fat stores and inhibition of fatty acid\par
synthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-\par
mone administration is followed by hyper-\par
glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effect\par
on carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-\par
jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, and\par
inorganic phosphate are retained following\par
the administration of growth hormone.\par
hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-\par
ment, an effect mediated through the para-\par
thyroid glands.\par
human growth hormone may be detected\par
in the serum through the use of the radio-\par
immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-\par
mately involved with the control of the\par
secretion and release of growth hormone\par
from the pituitary.  there is a correlation\par
between the availability of glucose for me-\par
tabolism and the plasma concentration of\par
growth hormone; when glucose is unavail-\par
able growth hormone is released in order to\par
provide a substitute source of energy, fatty\par
acids.\par
the administration of growth hormone\par
to the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-\par
lowed by growth in many instances, but it\par
has not usually been effective in promoting\par
growth in individuals with other abnormali-\par
ties.  acquired resistance to the effect of\par
growth hormone is accompanied by the de-\par
velopment of antibodies directed against\par
this protein.\par

results in decreased activity of the rna polymerase and\par
that the injection of 1 mg of human growth hormone into\par
the rat 12 h before death increased the enzyme activity\par
both in hypophysectomized rats and in normal rats.\par
however, the stimulating effect of growth hormone was\par
only seen in the absence of high concentrations of ammon-\par
ium sulphate; raising the ionic strength of the assay\par

studies on growth hormone secretion\par
in rats with the hypophysis autotransplanted\par
to the kidney capsule\par
the secretory capacity of the pituitary gland, autotransplanted to the\par
kidney capsule, was studied with special regard to the secretion of growth\par
hormone (gh).  body weight, body length, tibial epiphyseal width and\par
the mammary gland development after testosterone stimulation were\par
studied.\par
body growth and tibial epiphyseal width were markedly reduced in the\par
rats with transplanted hypophysis, but not as much as in the hypophys-\par
ectomized controls.  after injections of 0.25 mg testosterone propionate\par
daily for 10 days, only a few groups of alveoli were seen in the mam-\par
mary glands of the transplanted rats.  these observations show that there\par
is a considerable deficiency of gh in rats with the pituitary gland auto-\par
transplanted to the kidney capsule.  however, the development of a few\par
alveoli in the mammary glands is in favour of the theory that a small\par
amount of gh is secreted from the transplanted pituitary tissue.\par
injections of a purified vasopressin preparation (pitressin) in the rats\par
with autotransplanted hypophysis did not influence body growth, tibial\par
epiphyseal width or mammary gland development.  further, no effect of\par
pitressin was seen on the tibial epiphyseal cartilage of rats with intact\par
pituitary gland as has been reported by del vecchio et al. (1958) and\par
hiroshige & itoh (1960).  these experiments therefore do not support the\par
view that vasopressin acts as a gh releasing factor.\par

the effect of human growth hormone in\par
hypopituitary dwarfism\par
human growth hormone (hgh) raben has been\par
used in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twice\par
weekly.  this dosage is probably in or below, but\par
certainly not above, the range of physiological\par
replacement therapy.\par
in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh test\par
hypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than children\par
without gh deficiency.  this test is valuable\par
diagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism.\par
a prolonged treatment with hgh accelerates\par
growth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in children\par
without gh deficiency.  growth rate, induced by\par
this treatment, is first above average and later average\par
or below average for age.  this decreasing response\par
to hgh is typical for the general phenomenon of\par
catch-up growth and is not caused by the develop-\par
ment of antibodies.\par
of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9\par
months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginning\par
in spite of a high n retention in the preceding hgh\par
test.  this resistance is caused by the development\par
of high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the very\par
first few months of treatment.  these antibodies\par
suppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism and\par
on growth.  the unexpected occasional induction in\par
man of antibodies against a homologous protein\par
hormone is of great interest.  the possibility that\par
these antibodies might be active not only against the\par
homogenous but also against the endogenous hormone\par
could have a far-reaching biological importance.\par

effects of short term administration of\par

the effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormone\par
was investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short term\par
metabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-\par
mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activity\par
in serum.\par
two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolic\par
response to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of the\par
parameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention was\par
greater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-\par
creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in this\par
respect.\par
the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range in\par
the two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growth\par
hormone.\par
all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which at\par
present cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growth\par
hormone treatment.\par
the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggested\par
that a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,\par

normally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.\par

influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in rats\par
bearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumor\par
the effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil on\par
tumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determined\par
in rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  this\par
tumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,\par
and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,\par
or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressed\par
tumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibited\par
enlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetate\par
significantly reduced both tumor and body growth.  thyroxine had no significant\par
effect on tumor growth but enhanced the somatotropic effect as indicated by\par
increases in body growth and organ weights.  thiouracil had no significant\par
effect on tumor or body growth, although it significantly increased thyroid\par
weight.  estradiol, cortisol acetate, and thyroxine each increased the plasma\par
prolactin levels of the tumor-bearing rats.\par

studies with human growth hormone\par
ten dwarfed patients whose short stature was of\par
varying aetiology were studied by investigation of\par
some of the metabolic effects of human growth\par
hormone, 10 mg. being administered daily for a\par
period of 5 to 9 days.  the patients were maintained\par
on a constant diet during a preliminary control\par
period, while receiving hgh, and in 7 patients from\par
2 to 7 days in the post-hgh period.  hgh produced\par
a reduction in serum cholesterol, with a\par
rebound on withdrawal, in 7; a delayed clearance of\par
fat from the blood after a fat load in 9; and the\par
appearance of pre-b lipoprotein in the fasting state,\par
as measured by paper electrophoresis, in all of them.\par
the fall in serum cholesterol and the rebound on\par
withdrawal of hgh has some relevance to the\par
observation that hypercholesterolaemia occurs in\par
some hypopituitary patients even in the absence of\par
hypothyroidism.\par
no change was observed in tests of thyroid and\par
adrenocortical function during the short-term high\par
dosage administration of\par
hgh.  hypopituitary patients show a considerable\par
retention of nitrogen on hgh administration, and\par
we have confirmed the work of prader and his\par
colleagues that this provides a valuable diagnostic\par
test for growth hormone deficiency.  the measurement\par
of urinary nitrogen excretion after the withdrawal\par
of hgh also promises to be a useful investigation\par
in the differential diagnosis of short stature.\par
nitrogen excretion in the withdrawal phase in\par
hypopituitary children returns slowly to its pre-hgh\par
levels; two non-hypopituitary dwarfed\par
children excreted much more nitrogen in the withdrawal\par
period than they retained in the hgh\par
period.  one primordial dwarf showed a negligible\par
change in urinary nitrogen excretion both in the\par

the effect of testosterone\par

not enhance the growth-promoting effect of\par

deposition of myosin, sarcoplasmic\par
proteins, collagen and alkali-soluble proteins\par

growth hormone and diabetes mellitus\par
since the advent of insulin the vascular and neurological\par
lesions have replaced ketoacidosis as the major\par
problem in diabetes.  although good control of hyperglycemia\par
and glycosuria with diet and insulin may\par
influence favorably the development of the ocular angiopathy,\par
there remains a high incidence of these\par
lesions with resulting blindness despite such good\par
control.\par
growth hormone may be a major factor in the\par
pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and its effects\par
may be a reflection of the genetic disturbance.  its importance\par
was first realized by the classical experiments\par
of houssay and those of young which revealed its\par
diabetogenic effects in experimental animals.  the association\par
of acromegaly with diabetes has been for a\par
long time the major argument in support of the hypothesis\par
of the diabetogenic effect of growth hormone\par
in man.\par

experiments on the contribution of somatotrophin to prenatal growth in the rat\par
hypophyseoprivus in a fetal rat induced by decapitating the fetus in utero\par
retards fetal growth.  this effect can be prevented by injected somatotrophin.\par
these observations substantially support the view that in the normal rat\par
shortly before birth the fetal somatotrophin from the developing hypophysis\par
governs in part the prenatal growth which occurs at that time.  although\par
complete hypophysectomy of a pregnant rat retards\par
the growth of fetuses, the manner\par
of its action is obscure.  in an individual litter, combined hypophysectomy\par
of the mother and hypophyseoprivus in a fetus retards fetal growth but not\par
to any greater extent than hypophysectomy of the mother without\par
hypophyseoprivus in the fetus.  in the intact fetus injections of somatotrophin\par
(armour) do not accelerate fetal growth, presumably because ample fetal\par
somatotrophin from the developing hypophysis is present.\par

insulin and protein metabolism\par
the present status of protein synthesis within cells has\par
been outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;\par
the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  the\par
effects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independently\par
of the transport of glucose or amino acids into the\par
cell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of high\par
energy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,\par
as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose and\par
fat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellular\par
effects of insulin in many tissues.  within most\par
tissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantly\par
at the microsomal level.  incidentally, other\par
hormones which affect protein metabolism such as growth\par
or sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.  the fact\par
that insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at other\par
intracellular sites as well as the above independent effects\par
leads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulation\par
of multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events.\par
the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on protein\par
synthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellular\par
glucose or amino acids does not mean that the\par
sustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  the\par
biochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabetes\par
which are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demand\par
varying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it is\par
also known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) may\par
be deficient while others may be produced in excess in the\par
absence of insulin.\par
it is suggested that the physician desires at least two\par
kinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his\par
patients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulin\par
action to pathological processes in tissues which have\par
not as yet been examined by the methods described.  the\par
other is the need for more accurate measurements of the\par
metabolic disorder and its control than such things as\par
urinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements,\par
the place of insulin in protein biosynthesis\par
must be kept in mind.\par

their patients were suffering from hypopituitarism.  the\par
conclusion that children with growth retardation should be\par
subjected to a short trial period of treatment with growth\par
hormone to single out those who are deficient in growth hormone\par
is therefore of questionable validity.\par
rather, because of the limited supply of human growth\par
hormone, it appears that much more stringent criteria for\par
administration of human growth hormone should be advocated.\par
every effort should be made to uncover the patients\par
who might benefit from growth hormone by utilizing reliable\par
tests of pituitary function and perfecting a suitable growth-hormone\par

on language disorders in young children: a reorganization of thinking\par
current questions and confusions about\par
the use of the term aphasia with reference\par
to young children seem often to\par
reflect semantic problems accruing\par
from professional habits of thinking in\par
terms of etiologic and pathologic labels.\par
it is argued that if the term aphasia is\par
generalized simply to refer to inabilities\par
or interferences in the development of\par
language comprehension and use, then\par
it is the task of an evaluating group to\par
describe as well as possible, and in detail,\par
the specific impairments of function\par
in each child.  this task commonly\par
requires the use of an extensive period\par
of "diagnostic teaching," wherein care\par
is taken to explore which sensory and\par
motor modalities are working and\par
which are not, and whether integration\par
of various stimuli is taking place.\par
some current ideas are discussed with\par
reference to descriptions of impairment,\par
causal factors that are fairly unique in\par
childhood, some thoughts about the\par
neurophysiology of the human "language\par
system," and some psychosocial\par
factors important for language-learning.\par
special attention is given to various relations,\par
in terms of temporal resolving\par
power, between sensation and sensory\par
integration.  a scheme, or model, is suggested\par
which may prove fruitful for\par
experimental design in attacking some\par
of these problems at a prelanguage or\par
premeaning level.  it is argued that the\par
proportion of "unknowns" can be reduced\par
by careful study based on information\par
about impaired functions within the sensory-integrative-motor complex,\par

stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradient\par
systematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbances\par
of infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for the\par
child's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed,\par
for his survival.  the most elementary precondition for consistent\par
maternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute.\par
it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children's\par
development can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage of\par
varying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a mother\par
who dispenses what seems to be the "wrong kind of mothering".\par
a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicate\par
the dynamics of the "wrong kind of mothering" and its\par
consequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges between\par
mother and baby consist in a give and take of action and\par
reaction between the two partners, which requires from each\par
of them both active and passive responses.  these responses form\par
series and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call\par
"action cycles," each completed in itself and at the same time\par
anticipating the next link.  i designated these seriated response\par
exchanges as the "precursor of dialogue," as a primal dialogue.\par
the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development,\par
influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts and\par
psychic growth.  it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitatively\par
as well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to at\par
this time as the "derailment" of the primal dialogue.\par
controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimental\par
psychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate the\par
mechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae.\par
in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychic\par
overloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue.  overloading\par
prevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiated\par
by him.  long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of "incompleted\par
action cycles".  the sequelae of this cumulation are\par
profound changes in the behavior of the individual.  these changes\par
are manifested in a departure from the norms of individual and\par
social behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individual\par
and asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial.\par
the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps even\par
caused,\par
by the nature of the social setting.  one setting, over-population,\par
is extensively discussed in connection with an animal\par
experiment, and the implications for the human community are\par

is not, as may be the case for phonological and grammatical development,\par
anything like a satisfactory body of linguistic theory and method as to the\par
terminal state.  while a good deal may be learned without such a theory, and\par
necessarily must be so learned, since the work in progress cannot be suspended\par
until such an unpredictable millenium, it still would be a pity if the\par
chance were lost for the interaction of the acquisition of data and the\par
improvement of theoretical notions.\par

ways: (a) by briefly stating the nature of the problem with regard to the\par
terminal state of verbal development, (b) and by indicating what present\par
and future contribution such fields as anthropology, sociology, and social\par
psychology may be able to make to the solution of the problem.\par

the speech production and spoken language of the deaf\par
the distinction was made between speech production and spoken language in\par
analysing the oral output of those with hearing impairment.  a brief review of\par
studies in both areas was undertaken, including the report of a new electronic\par
visual monitoring device, the glossal transducer.  it was postulated that the\par
deaf utilise a unique visual-to-motor conversion within the brain when speaking\par
and monitor conscously by tactile-kinaesthetic control.  the more recent\par
studies relate to the syntactical features of the speech of the deaf.  these\par
show that deafness creates telegraphic speech with reduced sentence length and\par
omissions of essential words such as functors.  the speech of the deaf seems to\par
contain mostly nouns and verbs, with a limited number of words used to expand\par
verb forms.\par

cognitive functioning in early infantile autism: an examination of four cases\par
by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children\par
the results are communicated which were obtained from an examination,\par
by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children, of four cases of\par
early infantile autism.  these cases had developed in such a way that a\par
reliable investigation by means of a mental test had become possible.\par
according to their full scale iq's the four cases fell within the category of\par
dull normal intelligence or less.  all of them showed a considerable\par
discrepancy between the verbal and the performance iq, the performance iq being\par
of much higher value.  the composition of the autistic test profiles was\par
characterized by a large variability in the subtest scores, discriminating the\par
autistic group significantly from non-autistic control groups.  the subtest\par
score divergencies, responsible for the large variability, showed a distinct\par
pattern, being specific for the autistic group as a whole.  this group could\par
be considered as a distinct group particularly by a marked tendency to achieve\par
poorly and far below the subject's average level in the subtests comprehension\par
and vocabulary, and to achieve superiorly and far above that level in the\par
subtests block design and object assembly.  by specifying the mental functions,\par
conditional for success in these four subtests that occupy extreme positions\par
within the autistic test profiles, it was concluded that the autistic patients\par
apparently were able to achieve well, or even superiorly, only if the task\par
could be performed on a purely perceptual level.  but they failed as soon as\par
an appeal was made to thinking proper.  this was thought to be due to a\par
disability in dealing with imaginary things and imaginary situations, or,\par
in other words, to an incapability to objectify what is not actually present\par
in the subject's concrete situation.  it is proposed that this impairment\par
could be reduced to a lack of symbolic means, being the correlate of a\par
defective or insufficiently developed language in the patients.  it is further\par
proposed that children suffering from early\par
infantile autism might not be able,\par
or at a later stage only, to reach that level of language development in which\par
words can be used as symbols,\par
representing absent things and absent situations.\par

despite concern over speech regression, tonsil and\par
adenoid surgery was carried out on 66 of these patients.  when\par

congenital heart disease, deaf-mutism and associated somatic malformations\par

genetic and nongenetic factors and\par
their role in the development of the malformations\par
are discussed.  it is suggested that the cardiac\par
defect is transmitted by a single non-sex-linked\par
genetic factor (dominant autosomal\par
inheritance).  in the presence of a normal karyotype\par

histidinemia\par
a review of published reports of\par
histidinemia indicates that this condition\par
has a variability of clinical and biochemical\par
expression.  three children with histidinemia,\par
born of a consanguineous marriage\par
are reported here.  they had blond hair,\par
blue eyes, speech defects, mental retardation,\par
and a peculiar eeg abnormality.  they\par
also exhibited characteristic biochemical\par
findings of the disease: elevated blood and\par
urine histidine, increased urine imidazolepyruvic\par
acid, and a sustained high rise in\par
plasma histidine following an oral histidine\par
tolerance test.  they did not, however, have\par
the reduction of skin histidine a-deaminase\par
activity which has been observed in some\par
children with this condition.  tests for determination\par
of heterozygotes in the family\par
were not successful.\par
parental consanguinity and normal skin\par
a-deaminase activity set these children apart\par
from other reported cases.  the first lends\par
support to the hypothesis that histidinemia\par
is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait;\par
the second supports the idea that the genic\par
fault which results in reduced histidine a-\par
deaminase activity can be expressed to a\par
different degree in different tissues.  these\par
children seem to represent a variant of\par
histidinemia where liver histidase activity is\par
reduced while skin histidase activity is\par
present.\par

interpretation within the metaphor\par
analytic investigation of the use of the metaphor was first given impetus\par
by ella freeman sharpe (1950), who explored the symbolic\par
meaning of particular metaphoric phrases with reference to the body\par
and libidinal needs.  currently, interest has become focused upon the\par
use of the metaphor as a self-conscious, rational therapeutic technique\par
of communication, of particular value with those patients who have\par
reached "the borderline of sanity".  ekstein (1961) and ekstein and\par
wallerstein (1957) have emphasized that the use of the metaphor\par
should be regarded as an essential technique for gradually establishing\par
communication and initial insight with borderline and schizophrenic\par
patients but that it must not be regarded as a treatment technique\par
in itself.  it is but a preliminary approximation to the final therapeutic\par
act, which ultimately will consist of a classical interpretation\par
at the level of the secondary process.  the use of the metaphor derives\par
its primary value from maintaining contact with patients who are\par
constantly in danger of being inundated by a break-through of primary-\par
process material.\par

evolution of a characteristic speech disorder in\par
juvenile cerebral lipidosis\par
juvenile cerebral lipidosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in\par
this country, especially in schools for the visually handicapped.  the\par
manifestations of rapidly developing loss of vision, seizures, muscular\par
rigidity, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and eeg abnormalities are well known in\par
this disorder.  a speech disorder described as a "lolling, stammering speech"\par
was mentioned by sjogren (1931) in his comprehensive description\par
of juvenile amaurotic idiocy, but this has not been emphasized in\par
recent descriptions.  this report, based upon an analysis of 5 cases,\par
describes the evolution of a characteristic form of speech pathology that\par
is invariably present in juvenile cerebral lipidosis.\par
the initial speech abnormality seen early in the disorder is a hesitancy of\par
speech and occasional repetition of words.  in time, dysarthria becomes\par
evident with slurring, nasality and impairment of phonation similar to that\par
seen in pseudobulbar palsy.  in addition to the dysarthria, a highly\par
characteristic perseverative speech appears which often has a close resemblance\par
to true stuttering.  this stuttering-like speech has been observed in 4 of the\par
5 cases at some time during the course of their illnesses.  as the speech\par
patterns deteriorate, the patient becomes less communicative and finally lapses\par
into mutism.  the speech disorder is often the most disabling aspect of this\par
syndrome.\par

relation of crying activity in early infancy to speech and intellectual\par

at 3 years, a borderline correlation (.32) with cattell iq at 15 to 20\par

labial supportive appliance\par
the patient with a repaired cleft lip and palate and an associated\par
displacement and deficiency of the premaxilla presents problems which\par
may be of concern to the plastic surgeon, speech pathologist, orthodontist,\par
and prosthodontist.\par
the upper lip may appear flat or retruded in relation to the lower lip.\par
when maxillary anterior teeth are missing, either congenitally, naturally\par
(as in the mixed dentition period), or because of neglect, the upper lip\par
may appear to be rolled under the premaxilla.  the lower lip usually\par
assumes a characteristic 'pouty' appearance.\par
this complex of tissue deformities also may be important in the articulation\par
of speech sounds.  fricatives and plosives are difficult to produce\par
correctly because of the malposition of the lip.  there may be interference\par
with direction of air current, contact of tongue to alveolar ridge, and\par
normal contact of lips.\par
corrective procedures are designed to improve the labial profile and to\par
establish more normal relationships of intraoral structures.  these\par
procedures, employed individually or in combination, may include othodontic\par
movement of maxillary segments, dental prosthesis, and cheiloplasty.\par
another more recently developed adjunct involves autogenous\par
osscous implantation in the cleft areas.\par

heterogeneity of the 'cleft palate population' and research designs\par

who are born with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate.  we must recognize the\par
various pertinent subgroups within this population.  this does not mean,\par
however, that one must always recognize the smallest subgroup in doing a\par
given study.  on the contrary, we would defend the use of fewest possible\par
subgroups consistent with the specific research purpose.  nevertheless, we\par
feel that time spent considering the purposes of a study and the subgroups\par
which need to be identified will tend to minimize the number of\par
contradictory results, and will assist us in the interpretation of the\par
observations that our insight and technology make possible.\par

early experience and the socialization of cognitive modes in children\par
this paper deals with the question: what is cultural deprivation and how\par
does it act to shape and depress the resources of the human mind?  the\par
arguments presented are: first, that the behavior which leads to social,\par
educational, and economic poverty is socialized in early childhood; second,\par
that the central quality involved in the effects of cultural deprivation is a\par
lack of cognitive meaning in the mother-child communication system; and, third,\par
that the growth of cognitive processes is fostered in family control systems\par
which offer and permit a wide range of alternatives of action and thought and\par
that such growth is constricted by systems of control which offer predetermined\par
solutions and few alternatives for consideration and choice.\par
the research group was composed of 160 negro mothers and their\par
4-year-old children selected from four different social status levels.\par
the data are presented to show social status differences among the\par
four groups with respect to cognitive functioning and linguistic codes and\par
to offer examples of relations between maternal and child behavior that are\par
congruent with the general lines of argument laid out.\par

recovery of mycoplasmas in the study of\par
human leukaemia and other malignancies\par
numerous reports have been published concerning the\par
necessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas before\par
the interpretation of experiments performed in cell\par
cultures.  such tests are especially important when\par
the presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidence\par
indicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of eliciting\par
a transmissible cytopathic effect.\par
in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses share\par
properties, such as size, filterability, morphology in\par
electron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability to\par
haemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interference\par
with virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certain\par
commonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth by\par
homologous antiserum.  thus, the absence of ordinary\par
bacteria and moulds in preparations eliciting a cytopathic\par
effect in cell cultures is an unreliable criterion for viral\par
identification.  great caution should be exercised in\par
classifying new agents as viruses, especially as myxo-\par
viruses, without adequate testing to exclude their identity\par
as mycoplasmas.\par

72,992 persons who were members of a medical\par
co-operative in the period december 1, 1963, to\par
december 31, 1964.  the annual rate of pneumonia\par
was 12.9 per 1000.  isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae\par
from throat swabs was attempted in over\par
half the cases reported, and paired blood specimens\par
were obtained in one third.  on the basis of laboratory\par
examination of these specimens, the incidence\par
of clinically recognized pneumonia due to m. pneumoniae\par
was between 1 and 1.5 persons per 1000\par
per year.\par
although peak rates of pneumonia occurred under\par
five years of age (45 per 1000) pneumonia due to\par
m. pneumoniae was uncommon in this age group.  it\par
was most common in children five to nine years old,\par
and was frequently the cause of pneumonia in adolescents\par
(ten to nineteen years of age).  the rates in\par
children in primary school was twice the average\par
incidence.  m. pneumoniae pneumonia also differed\par
from the pneumonias of other etiology in that it\par
occurred throughout the year, with no seasonal excess\par
whereas total pneumonia showed a predominance\par
in winter.\par
the typical clinical syndrome of the pneumonias\par
in which m. pneumoniae was isolated was one of\par
prominent systemic manifestations of headache and\par
fever, but few respiratory symptoms occurred except\par
cough.  upper-respiratory-tract complaints and an\par
elevated white-cell count were much more frequent\par
in the other pneumonias.  the patients with\par
m. pneumoniae pneumonia were almost never hospitalized\par

uncultured and primary amnion, two established human cell lines (rp am 1\par

related antigens demonstrable by hemagglutination.  after removal of\par

titer for the homologous cells was detected by fab methods.  in addition,\par
some changes in antigens on the surface of amnion cells during primary\par
culture were observed.  finally, an antigen was found on hela and hep-2\par
cells, by use of anti-hela serum absorbed with human erythrocytes and rp\par
am 1 cells, that was not found on either human erythrocytes, uncultured\par

the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-\par

a complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82\par
cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats and\par
mice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.\par
seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cell\par
cultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and one\par
saprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,\par
but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissue\par
cultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypes\par
from rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but is\par
probably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two species\par
hitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could not\par
be distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findings\par
illustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparing\par
mycoplasma strains by serological methods.\par
the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.\par
exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2\par
from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among the\par
strains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.\par
in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation of\par
an endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infective\par
material illustrates the importance of identifying these organisms\par
serologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesions\par

further observations of the lymphomas\par
of african children\par
during 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered in\par
cultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation with\par
supernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously been\par
exposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african children\par
with malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  the\par
results seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate association\par
between the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of the\par
isolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiar\par
spindling and twisting of the amnion cells\par
(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changes\par
in kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  the\par
direct inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bone\par
marrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissible\par
agents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,\par
the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.\par
the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media and\par
found to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to induce\par
tumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served as\par
antigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to the\par
disease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused by\par
the specimens.\par

despite their small size, the pplo carry\par

metabolism they are essentially like other free\par
living cells in contrast to the viruses which\par
have no independent metabolism outside the\par
living host cell.  several strains of pplo have\par
been cultivated from the mucous membranes\par
of apparently normal human subjects, espe-\par
cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.\par
until recently, however, definite evidence of\par
the association between the pplo and clear-\par
ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-\par
ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evident\par
that the so-called eaton "virus," originally\par
isolated by eaton and his associates in 1944\par

duced on a cell-free agar medium which is\par
enriched by the addition of blood serum or\par

problems of disease of\par

symptoms and prevent any further damage to\par
organs such as the kidneys.  in 80 per cent,\par
of such cases the operation is not particularly\par
difficult to anyone with experience of thyroid\par
surgery.  the tumour is seldom of great size,\par
usually less than half an inch in diameter, but\par
a careful search in the expected position, in\par
close apposition to the posterior surface of the\par
thyroid lobes, will usually reveal it.  such\par
adenomata are usually more brown in colour\par
than the normal yellow gland; but in some 20\par
per cent, of cases one or more of the glands\par
may be aberrant, or possibly absent, and super-\par
numerary glands may be present.  it is usually\par
one of the lower pair of glands which occupies\par
an ectopic position and, as i explained in the\par
outline of the embryological development, it\par
may accompany the thymus into the mediasti-\par
num, rather a vast area in which to seek a small\par
tumour.  such an exploration cannot be lightly\par
undertaken, but if the evidence is indisputable\par
the burden must be shouldered.  it is correct\par
policy, i believe, first to carry out a thorough\par
exploration of the neck, and if this proves un-\par
availing, to inspect the mediastinum through a\par
sternum-splitting incision some two weeks later,\par

second postoperative day was 8 times\par
greater than that seen in the same zone of\par
kidneys from sham-operated animals.  by\par
10 days after surgery the mitotic index of\par
the cortex returned to control values.  the\par
outer medulla also underwent hyperplasia\par
but only on the second day following\par
unilateral nephrectomy was the increase\par
significant.  an increase in mitotic activity\par
was found in the inner medulla of surviving\par
kidneys, but it was not statistically signifi-\par
cant.\par
both starvation for 48 hours and water\par
restriction for 60 hours prevented the hyper-\par
plastic responses in the remaining kidneys\par
2 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  when\par
water was given 48 hours after unilateral\par
nephrectomy (after 60 hours of water\par

activity were noted in the cortex of remain-\par

access to food was allowed (after 48 hours\par
without food) no significant increase in\par
mitotic frequency of the remaining kidney\par

revealed by radioautographic studies fol-\par
lowing the injection of tritiated thymidine.\par

compensatory renal enlargement\par
hypertrophy versus hyperplasia\par
after unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growth\par

protein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-\par
changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  by\par
the end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and is\par
in decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of the\par
increase in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is both\par
the primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-\par

the left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with corresponding\par
counts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in sham-\par
operated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex of\par
the kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritium-\par
labeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing com-\par
pensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simul-\par
taneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney after\par
nephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial re-\par
sponse by 48 hours.  the contralateral kidney in rats subjected to\par
ureteral ligation showed no response.\par
we concluded that the early response of increased dna synthesis\par
and cell division in the obstructed kidney was not mediated by humoral\par
factors; it was localized and probably had a different mechanism than\par
the proliferative response occurring in compensatory renal hyperplasia.\par

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension\par
renal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have provided\par

the present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renal\par
hypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection of\par
cases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors and\par
involves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,\par
intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most important\par
methods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgical\par
procedures.\par
at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-\par
striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it is\par
hyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and its\par
branches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.\par

pressure.\par

cell proliferation in compensatory renal growth\par
rats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of the\par
remaining kidney over a six-week period.\par
autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that the\par
increase in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-two\par
hours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to the\par
production of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubule\par
cell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tufts\par
contained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to the\par
one-week period with a slow decline thereafter.\par
rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model to\par
study the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.\par
the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced by\par
treatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and\par

thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlarged\par
cell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy and\par
adrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higher\par
than after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenals\par
could induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of the\par
parathyroids.\par

pathogenesis of polycystic kidneys\par
microdissection confirms our previous de-\par
scription of an uncommon variety of poly-\par
cystic kidney found only in the newborn\par
periods.  it is characterized by symmetrical\par
enlargement caused by saccular or cylindri-\par
cal increase in size of all collecting tubules.\par
the number and relative length of different\par
generations of collecting tubules are normal.\par
nephrons are present in normal numbers,\par
and their attachment to collecting tubules is\par
normal.  the pattern of the nephrons is nor-\par
mal except for minimal localized areas of\par
dilatation.  interstitial connective tissue is\par
not increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are in-\par
variably cystic.  siblings may be affected.\par
we believe that in such kidneys the be-\par
havior of the ampullae of the branches of the\par
ureteral bud is normal and that secondary\par
hyperplasia of the interstitial portions of the\par
branches is responsible for the greatly in-\par
creased renal size.\par

concurrence of hyperplasia and\par
neoplasia of the parathyroid glands\par
the concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasia\par
and neoplasia in a group of six patients is re-\par
ported.  two patients had long-standing renal\par
disease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia.\par
in both hypercalcemia developed while they\par
were under observation and they were found to\par
have parathyroid adenomas as well as hyper-\par
plasia of the other glands.  a third patient\par
followed an apparently similar course.  one pa-\par
tient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a\par
large mediastinal adenoma displayed hyper-\par
plasia of other glands in association with moder-\par
ate renal insufficiency.  two patients with pri-\par
mary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia were\par
found to have superimposed neoplastic lesions:\par
multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocar-\par
cinoma in the other.\par
these observations add new dimensions to the\par
diagnosis and therapy of parathyroid disorders.\par
they indicate the necessity of examining all four\par
parathyroid areas at time of surgery.  they also\par
emphasize that hypercalcemia developing in\par
patients with chronic renal disease is a manifesta-\par
tion of autonomous parathyroid function.\par

experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateraler\par
nephrektomie bei ratten\par
untersuchungen mit 3h-thymidin\par
in this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanism\par
of compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, and\par
autoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grown\par
rats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatory\par
renal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:\par
as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of the\par
mitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells was\par
observed in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division of\par
polyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.\par
after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividing\par
cells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reached\par
between the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateral\par
nephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.\par
all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.\par
although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,\par
one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in the\par
regenerating kidney.\par
in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined more\par
by mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidization\par
processes.\par
the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for the\par
assumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatory\par
renal hypertrophy.\par
proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to the\par
regeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of the\par
connective tissue of the renal vessels.\par

abscopal effects of whole-body\par
x-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophy\par
of the rat kidney.\par
the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), and\par
hypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys were\par
obtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  the\par
effect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiation\par
to the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following the\par
rate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.\par
when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratio\par
of kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-\par
hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days of\par
hypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent over\par
normal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.  for\par
animals 6-14 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy the corresponding\par
increase was only about 20 per cent.\par
following uninephrectomy and x irradiation with 1000 rad to the\par
exteriorized remaining kidney, 4 week old rats whose bodies were\par
lead-shielded during irradiation showed no body weight growth\par
retardation, no significant difference in the dna content of the\par
kidney, and a small but significant decrease in weight increment\par
of the hypertrophying kidney after 21 days.\par
rats exposed to 500 rad of x rays with the kidney shielded during\par
irradiation, when compared with nonirradiated controls, showed body\par
weight growth retardation, a reduction in the dna content of the\par
kidney, and a reduction in the amount of kidney hypertrophy 21 days\par
following uninephrectomy.  a still greater inhibition of both kidney\par
compensatory hypertrophy and the increase in dna content of the\par
kidney occurred after 500 rad whole body irradiation.\par
food restriction in nonirradiated 4 week old rats resulting in\par
body weight growth retardation, elicited a marked reduction in\par
kidney weight and in dna content of the hypertrophying kidney 21\par
days after uninephrectomy.\par
it is concluded that the reduction in kidney hypertrophy following\par
whole body x irradiation with 500 rad is due in some measure to an\par
abscopal or indirect effect, secondary to decreased body weight.\par

radiation effects renal enlargement in the mouse\par
three hours following unilateral\par
nephrectomy weanling female cf-1 mice were\par
subjected to local abdominal or total body\par
exposure to either 500 or 600 r.  other\par
groups were given 1350 r to half the abdomen\par
with and without prior nephrectomy.  signifi-\par
cant decreases in renal weight gain compared\par
to controls were obtained in the 600 r total\par
body group and in the locally irradiated ani-\par
mals given 1350 r.  when the renal weight\par
changes are compared on the basis of the\par
ratio of renal weight to body weight in per\par
cent, an increase from .64% to .95% is seen\par
in animals subjected to nephrectomy alone.\par
the final value in all of the irradiated and\par
nephrectomized groups was similar, ranging\par
from .93% to 1.0%.  the results suggest that\par
irradiation in these dose ranges does not\par
exert a direct inhibitory effect on renal weight\par
increase but it limits body weight gain which\par
influences kidney weight.\par

renal hyperplasia and neoplasia\par
in rats given dimethylnitrosamine\par
multiple foci of hyperplasia and neoplasia were induced in the kidney\par
of rats that had been dosed orally with dimethylnitrosamine.  the younger rats\par
and the male sex had a greater incidence of renal tumors.  the hyperplastic\par
or neoplastic lesions were classified into two groups on the basis of their\par
histogenesis, namely that of tubular epithelial origin and that of interstitial\par
cell origin.  dimethylnitrosamine is recommended as a useful chemical\par
compound for the study of renal carcinogenesis.\par
.I 678\par
.W\par
the role of age and x-irradiation on kidney\par
function in the mouse\par
female mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability to\par
concentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early in\par
life has no measurable long-term effect on this process.\par
kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuric\par
acid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from young\par
mice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or old\par
female x-irradiated mice.\par
it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateral\par
nephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation does\par
cause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the aging\par
mouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells to\par
undergo cell division.\par
the administration of testosterone propionate to old mice during compen-\par
satory renal hypertrophy results in an increased hypertrophy.  the increase is\par
relatively the same for irradiated and nonirradiated mice, indicating the lack\par
of a long-term effect of x-irradiation to reduce the ability of a target\par
organ to respond to a hormone.\par
the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-induced\par
aging," is that x-irradiation of the female swiss mouse early in life does not\par
have a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-\par
term effect on those processes concerned with cell division.\par

pathological and biochemical observations\par
are presented in two cases of virilizing ad-\par
renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losing\par
type and the other of the hypertensive type.\par
examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-\par
trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in the\par
case exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  the\par
adrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of the\par
zona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized that\par
the chronic state of sodium loss caused\par
changes in the intravascular compartment\par
which led to compensatory activity of the\par
juxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-\par
tion of the zona glomerulosa.\par
examination of the hypertensive case\par
(known to involve a different enzyme defi-\par
cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-\par
erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-\par
glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-\par
tion of sodium-retaining steroids associated\par
with the genetic defect in this clinical form\par
could account for both the hypertension\par
and the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-\par

studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheep\par
the intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-\par
taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectable\par
parasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemia\par
lasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia and\par
occasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in a\par
controlled experiment on hoggs there was no significant difference\par
in weight gain between infected and control animals.\par
a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearance\par
of eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that this\par
phenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.\par
the incubation period following the inoculation of infected blood\par
in ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight of\par
these animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, but\par
the two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed to\par
gain weight.\par
culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidney\par
monolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission of\par
the infection to mice.\par
the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfected\par
sheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by the\par
intravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.\par
the only characteristic histopathological changes in infected\par

the indian house lizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis breeds seas-\par
onally.  in a sexually mature male lizard, from october to\par
may of the following year, the secondary and tertiary collecting\par
tubules of the kidney are hypertrophied forming the sexual seg-\par
ment.  the development of the sexual segment is synchronous with\par
the testicular cycle and maximum development occurs during the\par
period when the testes are spermatogenically active.  the sex-\par
ual segment is not developed in the females in any season of the\par
year; it is completely regressed in males during sexual quiescence\par
(june and july).  injection of 4.0 mg of testosterone propionate\par
over two weeks stimulated the regressed sexual segment to hyper-\par
trophy in males during quiescence and also in females.  the\par
apical portions of the cells of the sexual segment are loaded\par
with granular secretions which are stained with baker's acid hae-\par
matein and phosphomolybdic acid-stannous chloride, indicating the\par

hemihypertrophy and medullary sponge kidney\par
congenital hemihypertrophy is an over-\par
growth of one side of the body which is\par
associated with an asymmetry beyond the ex-\par
pected range.  it is to be distinguished from\par
hemiatrophy in which atrophy or withering of\par
one half of the body has occurred, usually be-\par
cause of neurological lesions.\par
this condition of hemihypertrophy, though\par
rare, is very frequently associated with other\par
congenital abnormalities.  these include several\par
in the urogenital tract, such as hypospadias,\par
cryptorchidism, unilateral renal hypertrophy\par
and an increased incidence of wilms' tumour.\par
.I 686\par
.W\par
chemical aspects of compensatory renal hypertrophy\par
the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the size and composition of the\par
remaining kidney has been investigated in rats.  in normal rats the right\par
kidney is, on the average, significantly heavier than the left and has a\par
higher total content of dna and rna.  the 2 kidneys have almost identical\par
ratios of rna/dna and protein/dna.  after unilateral nephrectomy the surviving\par
kidney increases steadily in wet and dry weight for the 1st 4 days after the\par
operation.  this is accompanied by a much slower increase in total dna\par
content and by a dramatic increase in rna/dna ratio.\par
the rna/dna ratio in kidney is also affected by diet, being higher on a\par
high-protein than on a low-protein intake.  moreover, the rise in rna/dna\par
ratio that follows unilateral nephrectomy is greater in animals fed a\par
high-protein diet.  the changes in kidney weight and in total contents of dna,\par
rna, protein, and lipid phosphorus resulting from the feeding of a high-protein\par
diet were found to be of approximately the same magnitude as those in the\par
remaining kidney 4 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  the rna/dna and\par
protein/dna ratios are also greater in rats fed a diet containing 10% urea,\par
but the increase is much less than that in the remaining kidney after\par
unilateral nephrectomy.\par

the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-\par

the changes in water and electro-\par
lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazide\par
therapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-\par
deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-\par
ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-\par
dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-\par
tion markedly increased on the first day\par
of treatment, but the urinary volume\par
began to fall on the second day and per-\par
sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-\par
tion of the drug.  in the other case the\par
urinary volume markedly decreased\par
when the daily sodium intake was strict-\par
ly limited.  it further decreased on\par
hydrochlorothiazide therapy but after\par
sodium intake was restored it returned\par
to the pretreatment level despite con-\par
tinued use of the drug.\par
the antidiuretic action of hydro-\par
chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-\par
betes insipidus is believed to be related\par
to the sodium depletion state of the body\par
brought about by increased output or\par
decreased intake of sodium.  sodium\par
and water reabsorption in the proximal\par
convoluted tubules in the kidney in-\par
creases and the amount of glomerular\par
filtrate reaching the distal convoluted\par
tubules decreases.  thus the final\par
urinary volume falls.\par

the action of oral diuretics\par
in diabetes insipidus\par
chronic administration of chlorothiazide and\par
other thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidus\par
results in a striking reduction in urinary volume\par
with increase in urinary osmolality.  this curious\par
antidiuretic action was first described by\par
crawford & kennedy (1959), and though it has\par
since been widely confirmed in both the pituitary\par
and nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precise\par
mechanism remains obscure.  a number of\par
investigators have sought to explain the phenom-\par
enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions of\par
these drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &\par
carter 1962), whilst others have contended that\par
abatement of polyuria may be secondary to a\par
central effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst\par
(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).\par
over the past two years, we have conducted\par
detailed in-patient studies of the action of\par
various diuretic drugs of the thiazide and other\par
series in a group of 7 patients with pituitary\par
diabetes insipidus.\par

investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis in\par
patients with diabetes insipidus\par
plasma sodium, osmolality and serum\par
chloride, together with creatinine clear-\par
ance, were studied before and during\par
thiazide treatment of 7 patients with\par
diabetes insipidus.\par
the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%.\par
the urine osmolality was increased by\par
7-128%.  an average decrease in plasma\par
sodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolality\par
of 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of\par
8 meq/i was observed.  only in one pa-\par
tient was the creatinine clearance re-\par
duced significantly.  the thirst-feeling was\par
reduced even from the first day of treat-\par
ment.  the diuresis was not minimal until\par
the third to fourth day.  if the diuresis was\par
corrected for the extra electrolyte ex-\par
cretion initiated by the thiazide, the\par
antidiuresis was found to be operating to\par
the full extent even on the first day of\par
treatment.\par
it is concluded that the antidiuresis is\par
mainly secondary to the natriuresis and to\par
a certain degree due to a decreased thirst-\par
feeling; but there seems also to be a direct\par
renal action, involving at least a reduc-\par
tion of the glomerular filtration rate.  a\par
pronounced antidiuresis was found by a\par
water deprivation test after thiazide\par
treatment in one patient.\par
.I 690\par
.W\par
salt and water\par
the antidiuretic effect of thiazides is thus the\par
result of the induced sodium deficit.  the fall in\par
serum osmolality may be contributory by\par
reducing thirst.  as depletion of body sodium will\par
be self-limiting the major hazard to the use of\par
thiazides is potassium depletion.  treatment of\par
patients with vasopressin insufficiency type of\par
diabetes insipidus with thiazides is only indicated\par
for those who are intolerant of hormone replace-\par
ment.  in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus thiazides\par
have a more important therapeutic application.\par

of chlorothiazide and its analogues have been\par
studied in six patients with ndi, two of\par
whom were infants less than six months of\par
age.  dehydrated infants showed a dramatic\par
response to treatment.  with those unable to\par
achieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-\par
ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-\par
ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-\par
ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-\par
able degree of "escape" or resistance to the\par
action of the drug commonly occurred.  de-\par
spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-\par
diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-\par
thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet alone\par
is not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it must\par
be remembered, however, that this drug is po-\par

volume (ecv) and a normal to low-\par
normal total body water (tbw).  following\par
thiazide therapy (case 1) and during a\par

reduction of ecv and tbw was found.\par
untreated both patients revealed a se-\par

higher diuresis and a lower concentration\par
capacity was found on this side.  the\par

4 hours, both groups were found to show\par
a significant antidiuresis upright.  the\par
administration of ethanol during the last\par
half hour of recumbency abolished the\par
fall in urine flow and in free water clear-\par
ance during the first hour of walking in\par
the normal subjects and significantly re-\par
duced this fall in the patients with\par
edema.  sodium excretion in the normal\par
subjects was slightly but not significantly\par
lower when upright than when recum-\par
bent, but in the edematous patients was\par
significantly lower when upright and fell\par
progressively over the 2 hour period.  ad-\par
ministration of spironolactone or d-\par
amphetamine increased sodium excretion\par
during recumbency in both groups but\par
increased sodium excretion upright only\par
in the edematous patients to equal that\par
of the normal subjects.  creatinine excre-\par
tion was not changed in either group by\par
posture or drug therapy.  similar studies\par
were performed on 5 patients with un-\par
treated diabetes insipidus and on 6 pa-\par
tients with adrenal insufficiency treated\par
with hydrocortisone alone.  lack of al-\par
dosterone (in adrenal insufficiency) did\par
not increase the amount of sodium ex-\par
creted above that of normal subjects in\par
recumbency and did not prevent the oc-\par
currence of significant sodium retention\par
in the upright posture.  however, lack\par
of adh (in diabetes insipidus) delayed\par
the antidiuresis upright for 30 minutes.\par
the results indicate that adh release\par
is probably responsible for the reduction\par
in urine volume during the first 30 min-\par
utes after assuming the upright posture,\par
but not thereafter.  the excessive magni-\par
tude of the orthostatic antidiuresis in\par
idiopathic edema probably results from\par
a cause other than adh release, since it\par
is not completely overcome by ethanol.\par
reduced na excretion during 2 hours in\par
the upright posture can occur in the\par
absence of circulating aldosterone, but\par
the abnormal magnitude of the na re-\par
tention in the patients with idiopathic\par
edema probably results from hyperal-\par
dosteronism.\par

the use and mode of action of ethacrynic acid\par
in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\par
the use of diuretic agents in the treatment\par
of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had been re-\par
ported to result in decreased urine volume\par
and decreased clearance of free water.  a\par
study of the use of ethacrynic acid, a potent\par
saluretic agent, was instituted in patients\par
with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in an\par
attempt to achieve a significant antidiuretic\par
response while allowing a liberal sodium diet.\par
intravenous ethacrynic acid resulted in de-\par
creased urine volume, decreased clearance of\par
free water and decreased rpf and\par
gfr.  prolonged oral administration of ethacrynic\par
acid promoted a significant antidiuretic re-\par
sponse when the daily sodium intake was\par
limited to 60 meq.  the effect of ethacrynic\par
acid on renal function, potassium and chlo-\par
ride excretion, and uric acid metabolism are\par

the treatment of pituitary responsive\par
diabetes insipidus\par
in evaluating therapy in diabetes insipidus, it is important to note we\par
are altering only ten per cent of the reabsorption function of the kidney.\par
the kidney function in a case of diabetes insipidus is as efficient in its\par
activity as are biological tests.  the purpose of therapy is patient\par
convenience, economy, and normal function in society.  the diabetes insipidus\par
itself does not alter the life span, however, secondary factors may introduce\par
it into a health problem.\par
lysyl-8-vasopressin nasal spray is effective, offers a maximum of conve-\par
nience, and has produced no untoward reactions.\par
it is, as expected, ineffective in the treatment of extrapituitary (pituitary\par
unresponsive) diabetes insipidus.\par

antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide\par
in diabetes insipidus\par
and ch'iuan-lu\par
12 cases of diabetes insipidus\par
were studied during hydrochlorothia-\par
zide therapy under a fixed diet.  the\par
symptoms, blood pressure, urinary\par
volume, blood and urinary electrolytes,\par
plasma volume, electrocardiogram and\par
hypertonic saline intravenous drip test\par
were compared before and after treat-\par
ment.\par
a daily dose of 100-150 mg\par
brought down the urinary volume to\par
about 50% of the pretreatment value.\par
the initial antidiuretic effect was noted\par
8 hours after medication and the\par
maximal effect after the fourth or fifth\par
day.  owing to the kaluretic action of\par
the drug, 2-4 gm of potassium salt was\par
also given each day.  satisfactory re-\par
sults were obtained with dietary sodium\par
ion at not more than 200 meq daily, but\par
ingestion of excessive table salt fre-\par
quently diminished or even destroyed\par
the therapeutic effect.\par
the physical signs, blood pres-\par
sure and ecg were essentially un-\par
changed and the plasma volumes were\par
altered after treatment.  the hyper-\par
tonic saline test was improved in some\par
of the patients.\par
low salt syndrome was fre-\par
quently encountered as the therapy\par
continued over 1 month.  but this and\par
even secondary failure could be pre-\par
vented by timely use of intermittent or\par
alternative regimen.\par
the therapeutic mechanism,\par
indications and side effects of the drug\par
were briefly discussed.  the drug might\par
possibly act through the mechanism of\par
salt depletion, contraction of extracel-\par
lular fluid volume and decrease of renal\par
glomerular filtrate, and in consequence\par
urinary volume decreases and thirst is\par
alleviated.\par

the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on water intake\par
and plasma osmolality in diabetes insipidus in\par
the rat\par
a fall in plasma osmolality accompanied the reduction of urine volume in\par
rats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, given hydrochlorothiazide and an\par
otherwise normal diet.  the plasma concentration was not reduced with a\par
high sodium intake, although urine volume still fell.  normal rats and hypo-\par
thalamic obese rats increased their water turnover after hydrochlorothiazide,\par
yet their plasma concentration fell.  moreover the antidiuretic response to\par
vasopressin, which is purely renal, was also accompanied by plasma dilution;\par
although it is self-evident that rats which drink less are less thirsty, the\par
reduction in thirst after hydrochlorothiazide may not be a direct result of the\par
change in plasma osmolality.\par
as previously shown in patients (kennedy and hill, 1963) a high sodium\par
intake increased free water clearance in diabetes insipidus but did not\par
interfere with the reduction of polyuria by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas a high\par
potassium intake reduced free water clearance and prevented any effect of the\par
drug on urine volume.\par
.I 699\par

antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazide\par
in diabetes insipidus dogs\par
chlorothiazide was found to decrease\par
urine volume and increase urine con-\par
centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.\par
there was no change in gfr, rpf,\par
tmpah, plasma volume, extracellular\par
fluid or total body water.  the one con-\par
sistent altered function was a decrease\par
in "free water" clearance.  diazoxide and\par
mercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it is\par
believed that the antidiuretic action is\par
dependent on the chlorothiazide-induced\par
saluresis.  although the mechanism of\par
this antidiuresis has not been clearly de-\par
fined, it seems best explained by postu-\par
lating a decrease in filtrate reaching the\par
distal nephron (giving a decreased final\par
urine volume) coupled with inhibition of\par
solute reabsorption in the distal tubule\par
(preventing the selective reabsorption of\par
solute in the distal tubule that is nor-\par
mally seen, accounting for the increase\par
in urine concentration).  the possible\par
role of the mineralocorticoids in the\par
antidiuretic response to chlorothiazide\par
therapy was investigated in diabetes in-\par
sipidus and adrenalectomized dogs.  ad-\par
ministration of sodium-retaining steroids\par
to diabetes insipidus dogs did not re-\par
produce the urinary changes associated\par
with chlorothiazide therapy.  in addition,\par
the antidiuretic response to chlorothia-\par
zide was not altered by adrenalectomy\par
or spironolactone administration.  there-\par
fore, the presence of the sodium-retain-\par
ing steroids are not essential for the anti-\par
diuretic response of chlorothiazide in\par
diabetes insipidus.\par

stable strontium in human bone: geographical and age\par
differences in the united kingdom and their\par
correlation with levels of strontium-90\par
a re-assessment has been made of published data of other workers on sr and\par
90sr in human bone.  in different parts of great britain the mean ratio of\par
stable sr to ca in adult human bones ranged\par
from 240 to 475ug/g.  extreme values\par
were found even as close as 40 miles apart (carlisle v. westmorland).\par
perinatal levels of stable sr were correlated with adult levels.  an estimate\par
of placental discrimination may be derived from the ratio, perinatal level:\par
adult level of about\par
0.7.  the concentration of stable sr in bones of children from 2 to 5 years old or\par
more was not demonstrably different from that of adults except in one area,\par
carlisle.  with the striking exception of london and south-east england the\par
change from perinatal to adult levels occurred in the 2nd year of life: there\par
was no particular change during the first 9 months or so.  in london and\par
south-east england the pattern of change with age was quite different: there\par
was a progressive rise in sr level from shortly after birth to the end of the\par
1st year by which time adult levels were reached.  it is concluded that\par
geographical differences need to be taken into account when making\par
physiological deductions about turnover of bone salt from changes with age in\par
the level of stable\par
sr.  when children in the south-east of england and the rest of the united kingdom\par
were compared, there seemed to be a broad inverse correlation between levels of\par
stable sr and of\par
90sr.  detailed analysis of perinatal results from one area suggested that the level\par
of stable sr in bone was somewhat higher in summer than in winter and somewhat\par
higher in anatomically normal babies than in babies dying with gross congenital\par
defects.  90sr showed the seasonal change only.\par

meticulous introduction of a ventriculo-\par

congenital malformations of c.n.s.\par
it seems that only a small proportion of malformations of\par
the central nervous system can be explained in simple genetical\par
terms and that most are dependent, to some extent at least,\par
on environmental factors.  the nature of these has yet to be\par
determined.  dr. williamson found that the maternal aunts,\par
uncles, and cousins of her index cases of anencephalus and\par
spina bifida were more frequently affected than the paternal\par
relatives were.  she suggested that mothers of affected\par
children had some genetic factor which modifies the intra-\par
uterine environment and thus predisposes the embryo to these\par
malformations.  such a hypothesis opens up interesting\par
possibilities, but before accepting it one would have to be\par
satisfied that the higher incidence in maternal relatives is\par
not merely due to the fact that the history is obtained in\par
most cases from the mother.\par

experimental studies on cerebrospinal\par
fluid flow\par
a mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-\par
podium was injected into the cisterna magna\par
of dogs.  blockade of csf space was produced\par
successfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,\par
ventricular dilatation of more than interme-\par
diate degree was observed.\par
in these hydrocephalic dogs experimental\par
shunting was performed either between the\par
lateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-\par
tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and the\par
contralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-\par
directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. per\par
hour in the cases of the former shunting,\par
and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in the\par
cases of the latter shunting.\par
csf flow rate from the ventricle toward the\par
cerebral subarachnoid space was larger when\par
intraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-\par
crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-\par
sure probably results from an increase in csf\par
absorption.  there seems to be an upper limit\par
of the flow rate as the pressure is raised.\par
transient reflux of csf flow was induced by\par
jugular or abdominal compression.\par
following intravenous administration of hy-\par
pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreased\par
parallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-\par
gained the original value as the pressure was\par
recovered.  when the pressure fell as low as\par

functional craniology: an aid in\par
interpreting roentgenograms\par
of the skull\par
analysis of the form of the skull is\par
facilitated by considering it to be composed\par
of a number of functional components.  for\par
the roentgenologist's purposes, division into\par
the facial or somatic skeleton and the neu-\par
ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognition\par
of three functionally separate portions\par
within each calvarial bone: the inner table,\par
the diploe and the outer table.\par
the base of the skull is the only por-\par
tion that is preformed in cartilage.  this ac-\par
counts for the unusual appearance of the\par
skull in achondroplasia.  in addition, the\par
base apparently is more closely related to\par
facial and general somatic growth than to\par
neural growth.\par
calvarial bone forms directly from\par
membrane within the cerebral capsule.\par
consequently, the size and shape of the cal-\par
varia directly reflect the form of the grow-\par
ing neural mass.\par
the inner table of the calvaria at all\par
ages is intimately related to the dura mater\par
and directly reflects the form of the dura\par
mater.  consequently, the inner table re-\par
flects the form of the arachnoid mater and,\par
usually, of the brain as well.\par
the outer table of the calvaria serves\par
not only to protect the brain but also to\par
anchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsic\par
muscles of the skull.  its form, particularly\par
in thick-skulled mammals such as the pig,\par
is determined more by the demands of these\par
muscles and of the scalp than by the form\par
of the brain.\par
the principal function of the diploe\par
is to form a lightweight yet rigid separation\par
of the two osseous tables.  in addition, it\par
serves as a site of hematopoiesis; for this\par
reason it may tend to a specific volume at a\par
given age.\par
the calvarial sutures oppose separa-\par
tion of the bones of the calvaria while al-\par
lowing relative motion between them.\par
when the calvarial bones are passively car-\par
ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap-\par
sule by the growth of the neural mass, their\par
areas are increased by the deposition of\par
bone in the suture margins.  the sutures,\par
however, do not function as epiphyses and\par
have no innate growth potential: removal\par
of a suture does not disturb final skull form.\par
because the calvaria represents ossi-\par
fication of the cerebral capsule, it is small\par
when the neural mass is small.  the de-\par
formity of the skull and the secondary\par
changes that occur in the air sinuses and\par
the diploe can be explained in terms of\par
the functional cranial components.  the op-\par
posite changes occur when the neural mass\par
is abnormally large.\par
the correlation between skull size and\par
intelligence is only fair.  the presence of a\par
brain of distinctly abnormal size, however,\par
may be inferred from plain roentgeno-\par
grams of the skull.\par
premature closure of the cranial su-\par
tures may be due to an abnormal form of\par
the cranial base and possibly of the primi-\par
tive chondrocranium that precedes it.  the\par
abnormality is mediated through the dural\par
fiber tracts that underlie the major cal-\par
varial sutures.\par

hydrocephalus: changes in formation and absorption\par
of cerebrospinal fluid within the\par
cerebral ventricles\par
formation, flow and absorption of\par
cerebrospinal fluid were measured in normal\par
and progressively hydrocephalic dogs by\par
steady-state studies during ventricular per-\par
fusion.  the formation of cerebrospinal fluid\par
was found to be constant, independent of\par
hydrostatic pressure, and unaffected by the\par
development of hydrocephalus.  the normal\par
dog produced 0.016 ml. cerebrospinal fluid\par
/min. in the lateral ventricles, 0.011 ml. cere-\par
brospinal fluid/min. in the 4th ventricle and\par
0.20 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the sub-\par
arachnoid space.  the intraventricular forma-\par
tion of fluid was calculated to be 0.24\par
ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min./gm. of choroid\par
plexus, and 0.3x10-3 ml. cerebrospinal fluid\par
/min./cm.2 of ependymal surface.\par
absorption of cerebrospinal fluid was\par
found to take place within the ventricles as\par
well as in the subarachnoid spaces.  the re-\par
sistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluid\par
in the normal ventricle was much higher than\par
in the hydrocephalic ventricle.  the decrease\par
in resistance occurred as the ventricular\par
volume increased and the ependyma became\par
flattened so that in chronic hydrocephalus\par
the resistance was not significantly different\par
than in the normal dog.  the theory of re-\par
stricted diffusion was applied to the data to\par
calculate the diffusive permeabilities of crea-\par
tinine and urea, and from this the mean pore\par
radius within the ventricle.\par
using formation of cerebrospinal fluid\par
and data on absorption, the hydrocephalic\par
animals could not be distinguished from the\par
normal with sufficient accuracy to suggest\par
using this as a clinical test.  the reason for\par
this is that intraventricular pressure has\par
always been considered as if it were constant\par
when, in fact, it is changing constantly.  the\par
problem of ventricular enlargement concerns\par
the ability of the craniospinal contents to\par
adjust to and absorb the small but very rapid\par
changes in intracranial contents that occur\par
with each beat of the pulse.\par

simultaneous measurement of cerebro-\par

that in the normal dog the mean pressures are\par
related as follows:\par
csfp>ssvp>tvp.  the statistical relationship between the pres-\par
sures has shown a poor correlation of ssvp\par
and tvp with changes in csfp.  on the\par
other hand, in the hydrocephalic dog, ssvp\par
rises to meet csfp and is related to fluid\par
pressure in a 1:1 fashion.  this could be ex-\par
pected to cause a "non venting" of acute\par
changes of csfp and a decrease in fluid ab-\par
sorption.  it is postulated that the mechanism\par

the major cause of death and morbid-\par
ity in both groups is infection.\par
in the operative group, morbidity\par
associated with the shunting procedure is\par
related to obstruction of the shunt and\par

associated with mechanical breakage of the\par

of the cardiac end from the atrium.  prompt\par
re-establishment of a functioning shunt has\par
been possible in all instances.  periodic follow-\par
up examinations, irrespective of symptoms,\par
have proved invaluable in early recognition\par
of malfunctioning shunts.  septicemia usually\par
required removal of the shunt.\par
from the program of periodic evalua-\par
tions, including "bubble" ventriculograms,\par
studies of clearance of risa, and psycho-\par
logical testings, correlations showed:\par
intellectual ability seemed associated\par
with width of cerebral mantle;\par
width of cerebral mantle in hydrocepha-\par
lus decreases with ventricular pressures\par
of 120 or over; it increases with pres-\par
sures less than this;\par
prolonged shunting of cerebrospinal\par
fluid can give dramatic increase in\par
width of cerebral mantle, apparently\par
irrespective of basic etiology of the\par
hydrocephalus;\par
intellectual capacity could not be cor-\par
related with the basic etiology of the\par
hydrocephalus, but did correlate in-\par
versely with duration of increased in-\par
tracranial pressure.\par
the many etiologies of hydrocephalus\par
require large numbers of patients in each\par
group for thorough evaluation.  factors\par
favoring such studies should be carried out in\par
medical centers where appropriate disciplines\par
can study in depth.  prevention should be the\par
ultimate goal.\par
in the operative group, only 1 patient\par
compensated his hydrocephalic process and\par
no single patient demonstrated "arrest" of or\par
recovery from the basic hydrocephalus-pro-\par
ducing process in spite of numerous attempts\par
to demonstrate this.  this might imply a\par
necessity for life-long shunting of cerebro-\par
spinal fluid in these cases.\par

hydrocephalus\par
any present day definition of\par
hydrocephalus is very loose.  the\par
authors would rather adopt the\par
concept that hydrocephalus is an\par
abnormal condition characterized\par
by excessive amount of cerebrospi-\par
nal fluid with or without enlarge-\par
ment of the head.\par
the most common cause of\par
hydrocephalus is arachnoiditis fol-\par
lowed by congenital anomalies.  a\par
neoplasm is a rare cause.\par
the ideal surgical procedure\par
is the placement of a ventriculo-\par
atrial shunt, using either pudenz\par
or halter valves.  where these\par
valves cannot be availed of the\par
choice is between a conservative\par
waiting with medical support and\par
ventricular tapping from the older\par
surgical shunting procedures, like,\par
ventriculo-peritoneal, choroidoplex-\par
ectomy, thecal-fimbia, subarach-\par
noid-ureteral, and others.\par

the importance of monitoring programs\par
to record the occurrence of congenital\par
malformations at group (for example,\par
hospital) and community (especially\par
city) levels.  the principle of report-\par
ing malformations and utilizing the\par
data for service programs or, better\par
still, for prevention, is not new, but\par
the methodical use of vital statistics\par
in a scientifically constructed surveil-\par

joint endeavor on the part of clinicians,\par
public health workers and basic scien-\par

pulmonary vascular changes complicating\par

the histologic sections of lung tissue obtained from 65 patients with hy-\par
drocephalus who died at various intervals following placement of a\par
ventriculovascular shunting apparatus were reviewed with regard to vas-\par
cular alterations.  a high incidence of "old" and "multiple" pulmonary\par
vascular lesions was found in this group compared to the incidence\par
in control subjects.  this difference can be attributed to the operative\par
procedure.  the lesions in postmortem material were not\par
widespread and did not suggest the diagnosis\par
of pulmonary hypertension on purely histologic grounds.\par

etiology of trypan blue induced antenatal\par
hydrocephalus in the albino rat\par
wistar strain albino rats were injected with 1 cm3 of a 1% solution\par
of trypan blue.  three types of dye were used: matheson, coleman and bell,\par
chroma-gesellschaft and a highly purified sample.  the dyes were injected on\par
days 6, 7, and 8 of gestation.  fetuses were excised from days 16 through 20,\par
fixed, decalcified where necessary, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned\par
and stained.  newborn young were treated similarly.  chroma-gesellschaft\par
trypan blue was without reproductive or teratogenic effect at the above doses.\par
increasing the dose did not increase the teratogenicity but did yield a\par
decrease in litter size.  both matheson, coleman and bell trypan blue and the\par
purified sample were teratogenic.  the most frequent neural defect observed\par
was hydrocephalus.  serial sections of the newborn hydrocephalics showed an\par
occluded or extremely tenotic aqueduct of sylvius in 31 of 33 sectioned\par
animals.  the fetuses collected from days 18 through 20 also had occluded or\par
stenotic aqueducts if hydrocephalic.  aqueductal stenosis or occlusion was\par
present in 17-day-old fetuses, but hydrocephalus was not conclusively\par
demonstrated at this age.  sixteen-day-old fetuses did not have aqueductal\par
occlusion in any of those examined, but stenosis was evident.  it is concluded\par
that the defect predisposing to hydrocephalus in the young of trypan blue\par
treated rats of this strain is aqueductal stenosis or occlusion.\par

bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus\par
a rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus\par
in a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-\par
sented.\par
the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspected\par
during life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributed\par
to either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.\par
after post mortem examination, it was evident that\par
the hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretion\par
from the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of the\par
sylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-\par
brane.\par
an interesting and uncommon additional feature of\par
this case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-\par

means of determining whether or not\par

accurate method for early detection\par
of hydrocephalus.  charts of normal\par
head size of full-term and premature\par

two types of microfilariae were\par
found in blood films: one was wuchereria bancrofti\par
and the other, referred to as the timor\par
microfilaria, is probably a new species.\par
blood surveys showed that\par
w. bancrofti and the timor microfilaria were widely\par
distributed in the territory but that infection\par
rates were usually low.\par
clinical lesions were few and mild;\par
elephantiasis was confined to oedema of the\par
lower limbs below the knee.\par
the timor microfilaria resembles\par
that of brugia malayi in general staining\par
reaction and appearance and in the possession\par
of two nuclei in the terminal thread, but\par
differs in over-all length, in cephalic-space ratio,\par
and in failure of the sheath to stain with\par
giemsa.  it is nocturnally periodic.  it was\par

were commonly found in the intestinal tract.  oesophagostomum\par
stephanostomum eggs were consistently present in the stools of\par

iv.--experimental hybridization of the human and\par
simian strains of loa\par
in the cameroons rain-forest there exist two strains of loa, each apparently\par
evolving in its own host-vector complex (duke and wijers, 1958).  the natural\par
simian parasite which is found most abundantly in the drill (mandrillus\par
leucophaeus), is characterized by the large somatic size of the adult worms\par
and microfilariae and by its nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  it is\par
transmitted among the monkey population by the crepuscular canopy-dwelling\par
chrysops langi and c. centurionis.  the natural human parasite has diurnally\par
periodic microfilariae and is transmitted by the day-biting anthropophilic\par
c. silacea and c. dimidiata (bombe form).  it can also be transmitted\par
experimentally to the drill, in which host the parasites are of small somatic\par
size and maintain their diurnal periodicity.\par
as the two strains of contrasting periodicity can be maintained in drills, it\par
was decided to try cross-mating them to produce hybrids.  the present paper\par
describes the methods by which this was done, records the characteristics of\par
the hybrid parasites, and suggests that, when interbreeding, the two strains\par
segregate according to a simple mendelian pattern as regards periodicity and\par
somatic size.\par

advances in filariasis\par
especially concerning periodicity of microfilariae\par
a review is given of some advances in our knowledge about filariasis during the\par
past ten years.\par
it is urged that investigations should be continued on methods to facilitate\par
the control of filariasis in large populations, by means of\par
diethylcarbamazine--e.g. incorporation of the compound in cooking salt, as\par
was done with chloroquine against malaria.  furthermore, steps should be taken\par
to protect young people against filariasis by systematic treatment in the\par
schools.\par
in order to understand the cyclical disappearance of microfilariae from the\par
peripheral blood and their accumulation in the lungs, the movements of\par
microfilariae in the pulmonary capillaries has been studied by cinematography.\par
apparently their accumulation in the lungs is not due to mechanical retention,\par
but perhaps they migrate round and round in the pre-capillary network of\par
arterioles.\par
the periodicity of microfilariae is best considered as a biological rhythm.\par
apparently the microfilariae have a circadian rhythm of their own which is\par
entrained and synchronized by stimuli from the circadian rhythm of the host.\par
judging by experiments with monkeys containing microfilariae of edesonfilaria\par
malayensis, the most effective of these stimuli from the host seems to be the\par
rhythmic variation of body temperature which occurs every 24 hours.\par

the periodicity of microfilariae.\par
x. the relation between the circadian temperature cycle\par
of monkeys and the microfilarial cycle.\par
monkeys were used whose blood contained the microfilariae of edesonfilaria\par
malayensis, which has a nocturnal periodicity.\par
artificial lowering of the body temperature during the daytime caused the\par
microfilaria count in the blood to rise; and artificial raising of the body\par
temperature during the night caused it to fall almost to zero, i.e. inversion\par
of the normal circadian temperature rhythm of the body was followed by\par
inversion of the microfilarial rhythm.\par
the hypothesis is put forward that the circadian rhythm of the microfilariae\par
of e. malayensis (but probably not of the microfilariae of some other species)\par
is entrained by the circadian rhythm of body temperature, which thus provides\par
the "effective stimuli" to which these microfilariae respond.\par

biliary tract morphology and prognosis\par

in 86 infants who did not have extrahepatic "hepatic" ducts, present\par
observation after use of artificial\par

correlations among minimal hepatic fibrosis, maximal bile ductule\par
proliferations and the presence of the gallbladder were noted.\par
it is suspected that if any opportunity for long-term survivals exists for\par
infants to overcome the tragic occurrence of biliary atresia that the\par
surgeon should avoid trauma to the hepatic pedicle.\par

neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenital\par

neuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenital\par

loss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in the\par
gracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely in\par
other parts of the central nervous system.\par
the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to that\par
in patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamin\par
e-deficient rats.\par
it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients\par
with congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin e\par
deficiency.\par
the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seen\par
in aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a group\par
of heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatz\par
disease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditions\par
warrants further investigation as to the possible metabolic\par

liver biopsy, are discussed.  although an operable lesion was detected at\par
laparotomy in only one baby, 5 further potentially correctable lesions were\par
discovered in the 14 necropsies performed.  review of the literature revealed\par
that few authors have discussed necropsy findings and that confirmation of the\par
diagnosis by liver biopsy has been neglected in many cases, including some\par
of those claimed as surgical cures.  it is concluded that the frequency of\par
potentially operable forms of biliary atresia is not really known.\par

radioactive bilirubin was injected intravenously\par
into 3 children with biliary atresia.  the isotope\par
over a period of ten to fourteen days was recovered\par
principally in the urine.  sixty per cent of the label\par
in the urine was found to be in the form of bili-\par
rubin.  distribution of the radioisotope was observed\par
to be principally extravascular but not, as in other\par
forms of jaundice, in the same distribution as albumin.\par
daily turnover of bilirubin was several times greater\par
than the calculated normal daily production of bili-\par
rubin.  this was assumed to be due to increased\par
hemoglobin breakdown, confirmed by survival studies\par
of cr51-tagged red cells.  the serum half-life of intra-\par

useful prognostic value in children with biliary atresia.\par

approaching adulthood values postnatally (fig.1).  embryonal liver\par

ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during development\par
mammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changes\par
during the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of these\par
events are associated with the derepression or repression of certain enzymes\par
which may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvement\par
of ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genome\par
into the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study of\par
biosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effort\par
in this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as well\par
as in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.\par
accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism which\par

an electron microscopic study of developing gall\par
bladder epithelium in the rabbit\par
the gall bladder epithelium of the\par
adult rabbit consists of two types of cells.\par
the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption,\par
notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration of\par
the lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces.  the mitochondria are\par
concentrated in a subapical band.\par
the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknown\par
function but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell.\par
foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito-\par
chondria are uniformly distributed.  in addition they display basal granules\par
and apical apocrine bullae.\par
epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 days\par
after birth or just after.\par
just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smooth\par
outlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis.\par
adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino-\par
cytosis subsides.  it is believed that water resorption occurs before the\par
functional changes which allow continuous passage of water into the\par
circulation.\par

lesions of the liver in hereditary\par

whether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,\par

mutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several cell\par
types are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement in\par
many such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-\par
chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently not\par
been defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)\par
gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, or\par
major deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have been\par
described.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liver\par

the inhibition of cell aggregation by a pure\par

the aggregation of embryonic chick and quail limb bud, heart and liver cells\par

a new method of assessing aggregation is described and evaluated; this\par
method involved measurements of aggregation kinetics.  it was found that the\par
measured kinetics agree closely with flocculation kinetics, which provides a\par
direct quantitative measurement of adhesiveness in terms of the\par
probability of an adhesion forming on contact between two cells.\par
using this technique it was confirmed that aggregation is inhibited at\par
1-2 c. in the presence of serum but not in its absence.  the kinetics of\par
aggregation in the presence of serum at 37 c., the lack of inhibition of\par
aggregation at 1-2 c. by serum which has been 'conditioned' by the presence of\par
cells, and the similar lack of inhibitory power of serum which has been\par
pre-treated with antiserum antibodies, all suggest that serum contains a\par
factor which inhibits aggregation until destroyed by cellular metabolism.\par

the immunological development of the human\par
fetus\par
the normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-\par
globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and the\par
newborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion is\par
the observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains an\par
appreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother\par
(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during the\par
first 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism of\par
the maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is still\par
inadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for the\par
transplacental passage is the almost complete absence of igg in the serum of\par
newborn infants from mothers with agammaglobulinemia (3,27).\par
the transfer of the immunoglobulins appears to be a selective process\par
(13, 15).  while igg is readily transferred, there is little, if any,\par
transfer of iga and igm, as has been shown by ultracentrifugation and\par
immunoelectrophoretic studies of the serum (12, 16, 19, 20) and the analysis\par
of maternally-transferred antibodies (31-33).  with more sensitive techniques\par
such as the double diffusion test in agar or quantitative immunochemical\par
techniques, however, minute amounts of both igm and iga have been detected\par
in fetal blood as well as in cord blood from mature and immature neonates\par
(12, 19, 20, 23, 26).  since large molecules do not pass the placenta, this\par
may indicate that the trace amounts of igm originate in the fetus itself, but\par
transplacental passage has not been completely excluded.\par
the absence of immunoglobulin formation has been associated with the absence\par
of plasma cells in the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow of the normal human\par
fetus and the newborn.  it has been reported that these cells do not appear\par
until a few weeks after birth (2, 3, 14, 25, 34).  however, in pathological\par
conditions such as congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis the human fetus has\par
been found to respond to the antigenic stimulus with intrauterine formation of\par
plasma cells after about the sixth month of gestation (24,25).\par

galactosemie congenitale\par
this observation of a case of congenital galactosemia with\par

with very slight degree of galactosemia, the disease must\par

postnatal changes in the portal circulation\par

umbilical blood pressure and have a wide\par
by contrast, the trunk of the portal vein is narrow\par
and there is probably only a small blood flow through\par
it from the inactive digestive tract, though the\par
pressure in it is approximately the same as in the\par
umbilical vein or perhaps somewhat higher.\par
immediately after birth the liver is deprived of the\par
substantial umbilical blood flow.  the portal\par
venous pressure falls to about one-quarter of the\par
umbilical venous pressure at birth.  however the\par
pressure gradient between the portal veins and\par

due to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-\par
tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-\par
tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.\par
in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliac\par
level causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacral\par
anastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causing\par
their dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-\par
rent lymphatics.\par
in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results together\par
with risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chiefly\par
influenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-\par
phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglial\par
sclerosis.\par

to provide a high regional drug concentration\par
for days to weeks.  the patients have received\par
drug infusion for up to 45 days.  their course\par
has been followed for up to 37 months after\par

methotrexate with antidote therapy by\par
systemic administration of citrovorum fac-\par

this treatment was administered for\par
two purposes:\par

as a palliative measure for non-ra-\par

management of advanced endometrial\par

is presented.  the criteria for selection of\par
patients for hormone therapy and the sched-\par
ule of administration of medroxyprogester-\par

patients for objective changes only, i.e., by\par
visual, palpable, histologic, or roentgeno-\par
logic means, revealed complete or partial\par
remission with significant palliation in 8 of\par
20 patients (40 per cent).  response to me-\par
droxyprogesterone therapy is apparently re-\par
lated to degree of differentiation of the pri-\par

of tumor effect by serial biopsies during\par
treatment provides an index to the histologic\par

chemotherapy of breast cancer\par
the majority of cancer patients who are\par
referred for chemotherapy are in far advanced\par
stages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-\par
ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agent\par
to the involved areas may limit the results of\par
treatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-\par
usually responsive one.  the variability in re-\par
sponse between apparently similar cases of\par
cancer of the same cell type has become in-\par
creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as the\par
fact that 20 per cent of patients with breast\par
cancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  the\par
decisions as to the choice between chemother-\par
apy and hormone therapy, as well as to the\par
choice of the chemotherapeutic agent to be\par
employed, may be difficult.\par
as experience increases, the usefulness of\par
chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is\par
becoming increasingly apparent.  it also has be-\par
come apparent that chemotherapy cannot be\par
regarded as a curative procedure in advanced\par
cancer even though an occasional patient ap-\par
pears to have been cured.  however, the value\par
of the oncolytic agents in prolonging useful\par
survival time, ameliorating many of the dis-\par
tressing symptoms associated with cancer, and\par
providing the physician with an extra tool for\par
a positive program in the care of the cancer\par

is probable that within a few years chemother-\par
apy will become firmly established as an ad-\par
junct to the primary treatment of solid tumors.\par
perhaps someday a cancerocidal chemical will\par
be devised that can actually act as antibiotics\par
do on bacteria.  for this reason it is important\par
for all surgeons interested in the treatment of\par
cancer to try to keep abreast of the recent ad-\par
vances in the field of chemotherapy.  surgeons\par
should also begin to use some of the technics for\par
palliation of incurable patients so that when\par
these drugs are added to the armamentarium of\par
primary treatment of cancer, they will be\par
familiar with the various technics and the mode\par
of actions of the drugs.\par
5-fluorouracil (5-fu) has had extensive clin-\par

in breast and colon cancers with about a third\par
of these patients receiving palliation for five to\par
six months.\par

carcinoma of bladder: cobalt therapy\par
from 1959 to 1962, 202 patients have received\par
radiotherapy for carcinoma of the bladder.  radi-\par
cal therapy with cobalt-60 has been done in 121\par
of these cases.  these patients received tumor\par
doses in excess of 5000 rad in 3 weeks.  of 49 pa-\par
tients followed for 2 years after radical treatment,\par
28 are alive.  sixteen out of 32 patients with\par
stage b2, c or d tumors are alive; while 15 pa-\par
tients survived out of 30 with tumors of grades\par
3 and 4 (broders').  four of the 28 survivors had\par
cystectomy performed and none showed residual\par
disease in the bladder or lymph nodes.  the com-\par
plications of radiotherapy presented were not\par
considered to be excessive.\par
we believe that radiotherapy should be the\par
initial treatment for patients with infiltrative\par
carcinoma of the bladder.  the survivals pre-\par
sented at 2 years are better than those quoted for\par
radical cystectomy (whitmore and marshall)\par

familial polyposis of the colon may\par

paper the following forms may be enu-\par
merated:\par
(1) an asymptomatic phase with dis-\par
crete polyposis.\par
(2) a mildly asymptomatic stage\par
with diffuse polyposis.\par
(3) a premalignant phase with car-\par
cinomas in situ.\par
(4) grossly malignant phase char-\par
acterized by anemia and carcinomatosis,\par
possibly of multicentric origin.\par
to secure a complete cure it is im-\par
perative that the clinician discover and\par
the surgeon treat the disease in its pre-\par
malignant state.\par
worthwhile palliative results may be\par
obtained by surgery in incurable cases\par
by extensive resection of the primary\par
lesions and subsequent resection of any\par
recurrences or metastasis, whether local\par
or distant by second and third looks is\par
necessary.\par

systemic chemotherapy\par
for cns metastases\par
of solid tumors\par
of the 13 cases studied, remissions were ob-\par
tained in eight.  this 62% remission rate is not\par
significant because of the number of variables\par
present.  however, we believe that chemother-\par
apy for this type of patient is indicated, as sup-\par
ported by the reported data.  the results suggest\par
that the blood supply to solid tumors is different\par
from that of tumors associated with hematopoi-\par
etic disorders.  the latter respond very poorly,\par
if at all, to systemic therapy.  although we were\par
not able to measure the central nervous system\par
(cns) lesions exactly, the regression of the\par
cns symptomatology was significant.  in pa-\par
tients who had other demonstrable metastatic\par
disease, those lesions also regressed.  with this\par
evidence we feel that patients with metastatic\par
cns lesions, even when these have recently\par
resulted in paralysis or seizures, should be con-\par

malcolm y. colby, margaret a. holbrook\par
5-fluorouracil in combination with supervoltage radiation\par

a total dose of from 40 to 50 mg. per kilogram of body\par
weight of 5-fluorouracil given by rapid intravenous injection\par
at the onset of radiation therapy was found to be relatively\par
safe and tolerable.  larger doses were associated with excessive\par
toxicity and mortality.\par
a sufficient number of patients achieved objective and\par

palliation by radiotherapy\par
the purpose of radiotherapy in the management\par
of cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;\par
second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-\par
ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief of\par
suffering to those who are symptomatic and in-\par
curable.\par
cancers of the lung vary quite widely in their\par
response to radiation.  those of glandular origin,\par
the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not of\par
modest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-\par
tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-\par
cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-\par
sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.\par
most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cell\par
carcinoma and as such may be considered to be\par
moderately radiosensitive in much the same order\par
of magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of the\par
skin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, be\par
curable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-\par
tunately, this has to date not been found to be\par
true.  the reasons are principally two: first and\par
foremost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancer\par
of the lung has more often than not, estimated at\par
80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,\par
thus making cure by any effective means presently\par
available unlikely.  second, the substrate in which\par
the cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation less\par
well than do the tissues which surround the highly\par
radiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma of\par
the skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-\par
favorable therapeutic ratio.\par

steroid therapy.  chlorambucil and pred-\par
nisolone were the drugs of choice.  these\par

serious or disagreeable toxic effects.  twen-\par
ty-four patients (33.8%) had objective\par
regression of six months' duration or long-\par
er; average survival time after therapy\par
was 23.9 months.  results are statistically\par
similar to those obtained with sex-steroid\par

of operation that the previously irradiated esophagus is firmly encased in\par
fibrous tissue, which gives the impression that the danger of disseminating\par
tumor at the time of resection is diminished.  in addition, the fibrosis sug-\par
gests that the tumor that had spread locally, beyond the limits of surgical\par
excision, may have been destroyed.\par

of particular use in handling the prob-\par

the care of the patient with "incurable" cancer may be\par

care, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti-\par
tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustified\par
premature claims for widely publicized methods recent on\par
the scene.  surgery and radiation therapy remain the\par
dominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  it\par
is unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiation\par
therapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the method\par
rather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient's\par
welfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapy\par
must be allowed indications and contraindications like any\par
therapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility of\par
the therapeutic radiologist.  application of realistically\par

in all cases, the initial intent was to\par
control with x radiation alone the primary\par
tumor involving the breast and its entire\par
lymphatic drainage.  irradiation remained\par
essentially the sole method of treatment in\par
84 cases.  postirradiation mastectomy was\par

initially had been considered inoperable.\par
the plan of treatment has consisted of a\par
single continuous course of radiation ther-\par
apy, protracted over a period of seventy-\par
five to one hundred days and administered\par
in 3 closely integrated phases.  tissue\par
doses, superficial and deep, must be\par
brought to the highest levels required for\par
maximum biological effects within the\par
tolerance of the structures involved.\par
the immediate effects of irradiation\par
alone have been remarkable.  the re-\par
gression of neoplastic manifestations in the\par
breast and palpable nodes, the degree of\par
healing of ulcerated carcinoma, and the\par

eeg abnormalities in early childhood schizophrenia:\par
a double-blind study of psychiatrically distrubed\par
and normal children during promazine sedation\par
eeg tracings during promazine sedation\par
were obtained on 58 children who had\par
autistic or symbiotic childhood psychosis.\par
for comparison eeg's were done under\par
identical conditions on 4 other groups of\par
children: 44 with chronic undifferentiated\par
schizophrenia; 37 non-psychotic children\par
with severe, acting-out behavior disorders;\par
10 with neuroses; and 13 psychiatrically\par
normal children.  final clinical diagnoses\par
were made without knowledge of the eeg\par
readings as determined for this study, and\par
the eeg's were all placed in random order\par
and read without any knowledge of the\par
clinical diagnosis.  eeg abnormalities ac-\par
cepted were focal slowing, focal spikes,\par
paroxysmal spikes and waves, and par-\par
oxysmal spikes and waves with independent\par
spikes.\par
among the 149 patients 51% had abnormal\par
records.  none of the psychiatrically normal\par
children had eeg abnormalities.  except\par
for the neurotics, the eeg abnormalities\par
were qualitatively and quantitatively sim-\par
ilar in the psychiatric patients.  the\par
most frequent abnormalities were ir-\par
regular paroxysmal spike and wave com-\par
plexes, often best seen during the\par
transition from wake to sleep.  of the 149\par
patients, 33% had this complex, either alone\par
or with independent spikes.  although these\par
complexes were most frequent in the au-\par
tistic-symbiotic group, the incidence was\par
not statistically significantly different from\par
the higher performing, chronic undiffer-\par
entiated schizophrenics who had communi-\par
cative speech or the non-psychotic children\par
with acting-out behavior disorders.\par
of the 58 autistic-symbiotic children, 19%\par
had seizures, which is similar to the 13%\par
seizure incidence in the remaining 91 psy-\par
chiatric patients.\par
whether the cerebral dysfunction im-\par
plied by this study is a primary disorder\par
or is secondary to some factor such as the\par
effect of prolonged anxiety on body chem-\par
istry cannot be decided at this time.  never-\par
theless, an organic concomitant has been\par
demonstrated in 51% of the psychiatrically\par
disturbed children.  by increasing the\par
amount of time included in the eeg sam-\par
ple, the incidence of electrical abnormalities\par
might be even higher.\par

on early infantile psychosis.\par
the symbiotic and autistic syndromes\par
in conclusion, i wish to state that the\par
core of child psychosis must\par
be sought in one or the other of the\par
described distortions of the sym-\par
biotic phase.  in the first case, what lay\par
at the heart of the psychotic dis-\par
turbance was the marked emotional\par
unavailability of the mother,\par
which alternated with a purely physical\par
extreme closeness during the\par
breast-feeding situations, and particularly\par
with the destructiveness of\par
the mother's unpredictable rage attacks.\par
the contrasting experiences\par
drove the child to the autistic warding\par
off of any human contact and\par
the de-animation of the world of reality.\par
constitutional factors could\par
not, in this case, be evaluated with any\par
degree of accuracy.\par
in the second case, it was, by contrast,\par
the mother's ever-presence\par
that created an unendurable instrusion\par
upon and interference with\par
the structuralization of the budding ego,\par
which constitutionally and\par
perhaps predispositionally may have been\par
very vulnerable.  this made\par
it impossible for the infant to experience\par
the normal alternation of\par
the gratification-frustration sequences at\par
his own pace; it also made\par
the process of individuation in the\par
separation-individuation period\par
one which was beset with abysmal panic.\par
in both instances, we can see that it was\par
primarily in the severe dis-\par
tortions of the normal symbiosis that the\par
child psychosis had its roots.\par

sensory dominance\par
in autistic imbecile children and controls\par
in a previous experiment (hermelin and\par
o'connor, 1964) it was found that autistic\par
and control imbecile children responded most\par
frequently to a light stimulus in conditions of\par
bimodal, simultaneous stimulation.  however,\par
the role of the relative intensity level of the\par
stimuli remained to be determined.  in the\par
present experiment a light and a sound, or a\par
light and a verbal command were presented\par
simultaneously in various intensity combina-\par
tions.  all responses, irrespective of the stim-\par
ulus to which they were made, were\par
rewarded.  autistic, mongol, and nonmongol\par
imbecile children were tested.  in addition to\par
a tendency for visual dominance results\par
showed that independent of modality, high\par
intensities affected all groups.  nonmongol\par
imbecile children also responded significantly\par
more frequently to the verbal than to the\par
sound stimulus, while the other two groups\par
did not.\par

twins discordant\par
for early infantile autism\par
a pair of heterozygous twins discordant\par
for early infantile autism is reported and the\par
relevant literature reviewed.  although mani-\par
fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'\par
physical development was different.  a spe-\par
cific emotional etiology was not demon-\par
strated.  the few available twin studies offer\par
findings consistent with the hypothesis that\par
genetic factors are relevant to the develop-\par
ment of childhood autism.  evidence is also\par
presented that impaired acquisition of lan-\par
guage may have hereditary determinants.\par
a second set of probably homozygous\par
twins are reported who were also discordant\par
for autism.  this second case suggests that,\par
although genetic factors may play a part, in\par
some cases the syndrome of infantile autism\par
appears to be a reversible one.  in view of\par
this set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,\par
the role of genetic factors remains obscure,\par
and more twin studies properly documented\par
with blood typing are needed.\par

.W\par
evaluation and treatment planning\par
for autistic children\par
infantile autism is considered to be a re-\par
action on the part of an immature organism\par
at a primitive and undifferentiated stage of\par
ego development.  little choice of defensive\par
reactions is available; the possibility of sub-\par
limation does not exist and, even though\par
other object relationships are gradually\par
developing, the mother is still the child's\par
primary object.  at this vulnerable develop-\par
mental stage, a wide range of pathological\par
circumstances, ranging from the most severe\par
family psychopathology to the most adventi-\par
tious physiological traumata or the most un-\par
fortunately malignant circumstances, may\par
constitute an acute or cumulative cata-\par
strophic stress.  the primitive organism\par
tends to respond to this overwhelming stress\par
with a paranoid reaction which is directed at\par
the mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-\par
cal variables) because the mother is still the\par
child's primary object.  we believe that the\par
child then responds with an autistic reaction\par
and shows varying degrees of simple with-\par
drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-\par
lusional thought processes, and consequent\par
disruption of developmental skills, speech,\par
and relationships with others.\par
many families can and do make every\par
effort to counter the paranoid reaction of the\par
child and do not respond to his rejection with\par
counterrejection and counterwithdrawal.\par
some of the child's autistic symptoms may\par
abate without formal treatment.  yet, since\par
the mother (and family) are the primary\par
objects of the child's paranoid attitude, it is\par
felt that formal therapeutic intervention is\par
necessary to modify the paranoid core of\par
the autistic reaction.\par

a twenty-five year view of\par
therapeutic results\par
thus this group of ten patients shows a complete range of\par
chronic schizophrenia from a bright pseudoneurotic never hospitalized,\par
to an inaccessible patient chronically hospitalized for 20 years.\par
physiological therapy in the form of metrazol-induced convulsions\par
given in the course of a puberty schizophrenic psychosis, has been\par
helpful to some by making them more accessible for the total treat-\par
ment program in the hospital or by raising their margin of tolerance\par
sufficiently so that they could live at home and attend public schools\par
at least for a time and at best, indefinitely.\par
several of the most regressed, deteriorated patients in state hospitals\par
for many years, have been brought back to some level of meaningful\par
living again by the current drug therapy program, and are still im-\par
proving.\par
now we have not determined who the sinner may be.  there are\par
many who will believe that the mother is always the sinner; is she\par
not schizophrenogenic?  there are others who will believe that the\par
individual himself is the sinner since, after all, is he not the one\par
whose behavior and fantasies are schizophrenic?  however, there will\par
be many of you attending this fifty-second annual meeting of the\par
american psychopathological association, who will judge the speaker\par
to be the sinner, for have i not given you this wealth of clinical ma-\par

autistic reactions in early childhood:\par
differential diagnostic considerations\par
the term "autism" is frequently used today\par
in the differential diagnosis of the severe\par
emotional disturbances of early childhood.\par
however, to label a child as "autistic"\par
presents some formidable problems with\par
regard to definition of the term, the specific\par
etiological-diagnostic implications, and\par
treatment considerations for any given\par
child so designated.  the purpose of this\par
paper is to briefly review some of the\par
historical psychiatric background of the term\par
"autism", its more recent ramifications,\par
and our clinical experiences in this field.\par
.I 809\par
.W\par
infantile autism: a family approach\par
the autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond to\par
stimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from external\par
sources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at our\par
residential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us they\par
appear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of being\par
insensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury on\par
themselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their own\par
bodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with these\par
children in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is a\par
display on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoerotic\par
behavior.  for example, one child who developed polio during his early stay\par
at the clinic residence did not communicate this to anyone and it was only\par
made known by observing the child's dragging one leg (memorial guid-\par
ance clinic, 1959).  later, he was able to point to his body and to indicate\par
pain.  another child, who at first seemed to be quite unaware of both himself\par
and others, concurrent with his growing display of affective expression\par
toward the therapist also manifested pleasure through genital stimulation,\par
was quite ticklish, and when injured would display the area of pain quite\par
readily.\par

an analysis of the language of fourteen\par
schizophrenic children\par
fourteen schizophrenic (autistic) children were studied by means of detailed\par
behavioural histories and observations.\par
the language recorded in history and observation protocols was analysed and\par
compared with available data on normal children.\par
all schizophrenic children were grossly retarded in their language development\par
and all measures of this correlated highly with a previous overall clinical\par
assessment of the severity of illness.\par
the most striking abnormalities in the language of the children studied were\par
stereotyped repetition of utterances appropriate to an earlier developmental\par
level or to a previous environmental context, accompanied by a lack of normal\par
expressions of curiosity and of responsiveness to changing environmental cues.\par

a behavioural and electroencephalographic\par
study of autistic children\par
short biographies are given of 10 children,\par
age 3 to 6 years, diagnosed as suffering from\par
kanner's syndrome (early infantile autism).\par
an analysis was made of the free-field acti-\par
vities of these children compared with a group\par
of normal children of similar age.  electro-\par
encephalographic studies were also carried out\par
on all 10 children, and in two it was possible\par
to carry out simultaneous behavioural and\par
eeg observations by means of telemetry.\par
the children were observed for three minute\par
periods in four environments of varying\par
complexity: a. an empty room; b. the same\par
room with toy wooden blocks present;\par
c. blocks plus passive adult; d. blocks plus active\par
adult.  except in a the visual fixations and\par
manipulatory activities were of significantly\par
shorter duration in the autistic children than\par
in the normals, lacked clear 'cut-off' points\par
and showed relatively little variability between\par
environments.  the autistic children as a\par
whole showed virtually no constructive play in\par
contrast with the normals, though more\par
time was spent in contact with play materials in\par
the social environments.  changes in the\par
time spent in locomotion, gesturing, block-play\par
and manipulation of other objects in the\par
environment showed that the autistic children\par
were acutely responsive to changes in their\par
environment, including the presence of the social\par
stimulus.  if the autistic children were\par
subdivided into those who characteristically showed\par
stereotypies and those who did not, the\par
latter sub-group showed a behaviour structure which\par
was very similar to that of the normals,\par
whereas the stereotypy sub-group was clearly\par
differentiated from both the normal children\par
and the non-stereotypy sub-group.\par
eight autistic children had waking eeg\par
records characterized by low voltage irregular\par
activity without any established rhythms;\par
one child, a record containing irregular alpha\par
and another unstable theta activity.  two of\par
the children with 'flat' laboratory eegs showed\par
more rhythmic, higher voltage records when\par
their eegs were telemetred in environment\par
a.  they also showed less stereotyped behaviour.\par
in environments b and d they showed pro-\par
gressively more irregular eeg activity and\par
more stereotypy.\par
the hypothesis is advanced that autistic\par
children are in a chronically high state of physio-\par
logical arousal.  the findings of the present\par
study and those of other workers are discussed\par
with respect to this hypothesis.\par
.I 812\par
.W\par
the autistic child in the school and the\par
school-nurse teacher responsibility\par
autistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreating\par
from reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.\par
some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autistic\par
child as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.\par
such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the age\par
range of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-\par
sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care and\par
approval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when this\par
need is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteem\par
are deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severity\par
of the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  such\par
a condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-\par
phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause for\par
admitting patients to mental institutions.\par
another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the category\par
of a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during the\par
intrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized as\par
mental retardation.\par
yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absence\par
of an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts with\par
other people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where human\par
contacts are concerned.\par
.I 813\par
.W\par
the autistic child\par
the conditions most frequently mistaken\par
for autism are speech disorder, brain damage\par
and mental deficiency, each a prominent\par
symptom of the psychotic child.  careful his-\par
tory and close observation to disclose symp-\par
toms of withdrawal, lack of ego, compulsion\par
for sameness, and displays of intelligence\par
give incomplete clues to the diagnosis.\par
the etiology of autism is uncertain.  sev-\par
eral factors seem significant.  the important\par
role of organic damage of the brain is under-\par
scored by the coincidence of epilepsy, eeg\par
and neurological abnormalities in these chil-\par
dren.  in our series seizures of various types\par
occurred in 25%, eeg abnormalities in 58%,\par
and minor neurological deficits in 70% of\par
the cases.  environmental factors are quite\par
obviously important in many instances.  the\par
emotional and behavioral pattern of the par-\par
ents toward the infant is often incriminated.\par
separation, inattention, coldness, rejection,\par
etc. have been found in many situations.  fa-\par
milial incidence of psychoses is low; so is\par
that of autism in siblings.\par

shadow therapy\par
shadow therapy was developed at sunland\par
training center in gainesville, florida, because of communica-\par

jectured that subjects would reveal their anxieties and conflicts\par
more readily in a simulated night situation.\par
the therapy was conducted in a darkroom with projector\par
light used to produce silhouettes and their accompanying\par
shadows as additional stimuli.  twelve subjects attended.  in\par
this article, the reaction of a child who was autistic and severely\par
disturbed is used as an illustration of subject reactions.  in the\par
playroom, he exhibited static behavior; in the darkroom, re-\par
gressive-transcendential behavior.  he also transcended his usual\par

the convergence and interaction of visual,\par
auditory, and tactile responses in human\par
nonspecific cortex\par
the relation between the electrical responses in the human brain and\par
mental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-\par
lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quite\par
recently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological concepts\par
by electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be receding\par
because of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, and\par
this difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and at\par
the same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,\par
although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect to\par
time, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the three\par
dimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display of\par
such a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yet\par
given entirely satisfactory results.\par
the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-\par
form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty as\par
to whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essential\par
to understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that it\par
would be sufficient.\par

infantile autism and the schizophrenias\par
in a paper published in 1943, entitled "au-\par

atric service of the johns hopkins hospital\par
observations of 11 children (8 boys and 3\par
girls) who had in common a pattern of be-\par
havior not previously considered in its\par
striking uniqueness.  the symptoms were\par
viewed as a combination of extreme alone-\par
ness from the beginning of life and an anx-\par
iously obsessive desire for the preservation\par
of sameness.  i concluded the discussion by\par
saying: "we must assume that these chil-\par
dren have come into the world with an\par
innate inability to form the usual, biologi-\par
cally provided affective contact with people,\par
just as other children come into the world\par
with innate physical and intellectual handi-\par
caps.  if this assumption is correct, a further\par
study of our children may help to furnish\par
concrete criteria regarding the still diffuse\par
notions about the constitutional components\par
of emotional reactivity.  for here we seem to\par
have pure-culture examples of inborn au-\par
tistic disturbances of affective contact."\par

tions in which the children can participate as actors\par
or as observers.  competition and restriction are\par
minimal: the child can do what comes naturally.  in-\par
deed, much of children's natural play is in the form\par
of dramatic activity.  their make-believe is, how-\par

problems to normal children but of a\par
more severe and frequent nature.  their\par
problems were predominantly in the\par
areas of speech and language develop-\par

orthopaedic treatment of joint deformities in thirteen patients with\par
haemophilia is reviewed over a period of seven years.\par
forms of treatment discussed include open operation, manipulation under general\par
anaesthesia, continuous traction, splintage and physiotherapy.  the amount of\par

in discussing prevention of joint deformity the histories of a further eighteen\par
patients have been taken into account.  it is concluded that initially painless\par
haemarthroses provide the main threat to joint deformity in haemophilia.\par
the best preventive treatment is early immobilisation followed by prolonged\par
splintage and physiotherapy; intravenous therapy with antihaemophilic factor\par
plays a less important role here than in other forms of haemorrhage.\par

logical in older children.\par

scalariform traits occur more frequently in haemo-\par

dr. le coeur thought that fibrillary decalcification\par
was the ultimate stage of decalcification, whereas\par
dr. favre-gilly has the impression that it represents\par
in haemophiliac subjects an early stage anterior to\par
homogeneous decalcification.\par
according to brinkhous, densification of synovial\par
membranes are a result of an infiltration of the joint\par
cartilage due to haemosideraemia; this is also the\par

an intra-articular opacification, observed in\par

densification of the synovial membrane was ob-\par

erosions of articular surfaces are especially fre-\par

hypertrophy of condyles or knee-caps, broadening\par
of intercondylian space, crushing of internal tibial\par

volkmann's ischaemia\par
volkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequence\par
of events originally described by volkmann in 1881.\par
basically the condition consists of the replacement of\par
the limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury or\par
occlusion of the main arterial supply of blood to these\par
muscles.  the condition is rare fortunately--mainly because\par
of improved methods of prevention.  the flexor muscles of\par
the toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group of\par
muscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm.\par
total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usually\par
causes frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorter\par
periods may give rise to ischaemic contracture.  the muscles,\par
being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub-\par
sequently replaced by fibrous tissue.  like all scars, the fibrous\par
tissue contracts, producing the complete picture of\par
volkmann's ischaemic contracture.  the forearm is thin and\par
wasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to the\par
overall shortening of the flexor muscles.  in severe cases, if\par
the nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass is\par
replaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysed\par
as well.\par

the prevention of crippling\par
in haemophilic children\par
children who are severely affected with haemo-\par

injuries.  these episodes of bleeding produce\par
cumulative crippling.  the haemarthroses tend to be\par
recurrent; each episode produces some damage to\par
the joint surface and the immobility during con-\par
valescence leads to muscle weakness.  thus after\par
recovery the joint becomes increasingly liable to\par
renewed bleeding.  the deep muscle haematomata\par
can produce crippling by actual destruction of\par
muscle tissue, by pressure on important nerves or\par
arteries, by contractures which develop during\par
healing and by failure of resolution of the original\par
haematoma leading to chronic cyst formation.\par

hemophilic arthropathy\par
jaromir priborsky, zora antalovska\par
the authors report their experience with joint\par
diseases in 54 patients suffering from hemo-\par
philia, 49 of them being cases of hemophilia a,\par
5 of hemophilia b.  21 patients were children\par
up to the age of 14 years.  bleeding into the joints\par
occurred in 66.6% of patients.  in the age\par
group over 14 years the cases of bleeding into\par
the joints were more frequent (78.8%) than\par
in the age group up to 14 years (47.7%).\par
there were no differences as to bleeding into the\par
joints and the seriousness of articular changes\par
between the cases of hemophilia a and hemo-\par
philia b.  in most cases the bleeding into the\par
joints began between the 6th and the 14th year\par
of age.  bleeding into the joints as the first\par
manifestation of a hemophilic condition occurred\par
only in 9.3% of patients; in most cases other\par
hemophilic manifestations preceded.  in spite of\par
this fact the joint manifestations were often\par
wrongly diagnosed as tuberculous arthritis, rheumatic\par
fever, progressive arthritis, and were treated\par
accordingly.  most usually the large joints (knee,\par
elbow, ankle) were affected with bleeding and in\par
them the changes were also the most serious.  the\par
joints of both halves of the body were\par
affected uniformly.  in most cases several joints were\par
affected while monoarticular localization\par
was observed in 16.6%.  the seriousness of articular\par
changes was dependent mainly on the\par
number of repeated bleedings into one and the same\par
joint, although other factors (weight bearing\par
of the joint, complexity of the joint, treatment) may be\par
of decisive importance in the individual\par
cases as well.\par
according to clinical (especially from\par
the functional point of view) and x-ray criteria the\par
articular findings were classified into three\par
groups: in the first group the function of the joint\par
is preserved, in the second limited and\par
in the third practically extinguished.  the following\par
laboratory tests were carried out: erythrocyte\par
sedimentation reaction, latex test for the rheu-\par
matoid factor, c-reactive protein, mecoprotein\par
tyrosine and weltmann's coagulation test.\par
the findings were normal even in cases of\par
irreparable articular changes unless acute bleeding\par
into the joint or in some other localization,\par
or some other complicating disorder was present\par
simultaneously.\par
the therapy of hemophilic arthropathy\par
remains troublesome owing especially to a frequent\par
occurrence of articular bleeding.\par
a close cooperation of the hematologist\par
and the rheumatologist or the orthopedist may con-\par
tribute to the improvement of the fate of\par
these patients.\par

orthophosphate were performed during\par
two selected segments of the 24-hour time scale.\par
the results of these studies suggest\par
that the circadian periodicity in relative\par
specific activity of brain phospholipids\par
is probably a consequence of a variation in the extent\par
of p32 incorporation into brain\par
inorganic phosphate and is not indicative\par
of a periodicity in the rate of intermediary\par
phospholipid metabolism.  data on the postinjection\par
time course of the specific activities\par
of plasma inorganic phosphate, liver inorganic phosphate,\par
and liver phospholipid\par
suggest a similar explanation for\par
the circadian periodic changes in relative\par
specific activity of liver phospholipids.\par
a circadian rhythm of inorganic phosphate\par
concentration in mouse plasma is demonstrated.\par
consideration of a mathematical\par
model suggests that the observed within-day\par
variation in p32 distribution and the\par
circadian periodicity of phospholipid relative\par
specific activity in liver and brain\par
are a consequence of this periodicity in\par
plasma phosphate content.  a significant\par
within-day variation in total phosphorus\par
content of liver was observed.  the disturbance\par

in the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filtered\par
load.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroid\par
hormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbed\par
in the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased the\par
rate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptive\par
mechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significant\par
transport across the renal tubule despite the presence of\par
excess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appeared\par

acid injection, compared with the small increase\par
during the first few days after unilateral nephrectomy.\par
there is a large increase in the water content\par
of the kidney after folic acid which does not\par
occur after unilateral nephrectomy.  the changes\par
in the wet and dry weight and the rna and dna\par
content of the kidney have been compared after\par
administration of folic acid, unilateral nephrectomy\par
and unilateral nephrectomy followed by folic\par
acid 24 hr later in an attempt to study the nature\par
of these differences.  after unilateral nephrectomy\par
there was a steady increase in wet weight, dry\par
weight and rna content of the kidney, each parameter\par
reaching about 35 to 40% above normal by\par
14 days, by which time the dna content had increased\par
by only about 25%.  an increased rate of\par
dna synthesis was found between 2 and 4 days,\par
returning almost to normal by 7 days.  after folic\par
acid injection there were very large increases in\par
wet weight (60%), rna content (100%) and dna content\par
(70%) during the first 4 days accompanied by\par
a smaller increase in dry weight (30%).  thereafter\par
these parameters declined, relative to body weight,\par
returning almost to normal by 14 days.  the rate\par
of dna synthesis was greatly increased as early\par
as 24 hr after injection and reached a much higher\par
level than that found after unilateral nephrectomy,\par
before returning to the normal level by 7 days.\par
when unilateral nephrectomy was followed 24 hr\par
later by folic acid injection, the increases in\par
weight, nucleic acid content and rate of dna synthesis\par
were greater than at the corresponding\par
times after either treatment alone.  marked differences\par
were found in the labeling indices of kidney\par
cells after either unilateral nephrectomy or folic\par
acid injection.  the latter treatment resulted in very\par
large increases in all three zones of the kidney,\par
whereas after unilateral nephrectomy the responses\par
of the cortex and outer medulla were much lower,\par
with no significant increase in the inner medulla.\par
when both treatments were combined, the response\par
of the remaining kidney was similar to, though\par

be duplicated by the injection of cacl into\par
the animal.  the data suggest that one effect\par
of treatment was a general inhibition of\par
oxidation.  the stimulation of metabolism\par
could be a consequence of this inhibition\par
or a separate unrelated alteration.\par

actinomycin and erythropoiesis and the production of erythropoietin in\par
mice.\par
in b6d2f female mice a single dose of 10\par
of actinomycin will suppress normal\par
erythropoiesis (fe erythrocyte uptake).  in\par
polycythemic mice 2 is enough to\par
prevent the stimulatory effect of 0.25 a units\par

hypothesis that erythropoietin acts\par
for a short time in an early stage of\par
erythropoiesis; after this early stage developing\par
cells are no longer so sensitive to actinomycin.\par
recovery, even from repeated\par
doses, is rapid and adequate.  amounts of\par
actinomycin which are adequate to abolish\par
erythropoiesis do not prevent the new appearance\par

the ultrastructure, histopathology, and\par

the parathyroid glands of pregnant and\par
nonpregnant cows were studied by light and\par
electron microscopy following the daily\par
feeding of 30 million units of vit d for 30\par
days and compared to untreated controls.\par
in both the pregnant and nonpregnant cows\par
the parathyroid glands became markedly\par
atrophic with a diminution in the amount of\par
parenchyma compared to the untreated controls.\par
after vit d feeding the number of\par
actively secreting dark and intermediate\par
chief cells was reduced and the percentage\par
of inactive (light) and atrophic chief cells\par
was increased.  the parathyroid glands\par
of the vit d-fed, nonpregnant cows were\par
dominated by severely atrophic chief cells.\par
these cells were characterized by their\par
highly irregular shape, shrunken nucleus\par
and cytoplasm, widened intercellular spaces\par
traversed by numerous cytoplasmic\par
processes, increased electron density, few\par
secretory granules, inactive ergastoplasm\par
and golgi complexes.  atrophic chief\par
cells were not present in the untreated\par
controls.  the predominating cell type in\par
the parathyroids of the vit d-fed pregnant\par
cows were the inactive chief cells.  in contrast\par
to the atrophic chief cells, they were\par
larger and more regular in shape with\par
relatively straight cell membranes.  they\par
were comparatively electron-transparent,\par
containing more glycogen and fewer\par
secretory granules.  organelles concerned\par
with protein synthesis and packaging into\par
secretory units were poorly developed.\par

the isolation of thyrocalcitonin and study of its effects in the rat.\par

and phosphate.  the hormone\par
can be extracted from\par
the thyroid of the rat, dog,\par

the isolation of the hormone\par
from pig thyroid by a combination\par
of salt fractionation\par

active in the rat.  thyrocalcitonin\par
remains effective after\par

with vitamin d, during vitamin\par
d deficiency, and during\par
calcium or magnesium deficiency.\par
its action is not prevented\par
by prior administration\par
of actinomycin d.  a\par
single injection does not change\par
soft tissue calcium but\par
infusion for 12 hr lowers cardiac\par

the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-induced\par
change in bone and kidney.\par
actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known to\par
inhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,\par
was used to study parathyroid-induced changes\par
in ca mobilization in vivo and in vitro\par
as well as renal excretion of ca and phosphate\par
in rats.  intact and parathyroidectomized\par
rats subjected to peritoneal lavage were\par
administered amd, and changes in\par
ca, p, and mg in lavage and serum were\par
examined.  amd consistently lowered the\par
ca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in both\par
the intact and parathyroidectomized animals,\par
although the drop in ca was more acute\par
if the animals were pretreated by subcutaneous\par
injections of amd than if amd was\par
administered as a component of the\par
rinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals with\par
amd prevented the expected increase\par
in osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysis\par
of the femur but had no effect if administered\par
as a component of the peritoneal rinse.\par
the incubation of femora removed\par
from both intact and parathyroidectomized\par
animals resulted in media ca levels that\par
were significantly lower after 4 hr. incubation\par
when amd was added in vitro.  however,\par
transfer of recently injected ca into\par
the incubation medium from animals\par
treated with amd was increased.  in addition,\par
parathyroidectomy of animals subsequent\par
to administration of amd still resulted\par
in expected changes in ca and p in the\par
urine although amd significantly increased p\par
excretion in both intact and parathyroidectomized\par
animals.  it was concluded that\par
endogenous parathyroid hormone requires\par
the continuous production of enzymes ultimately\par
responsible for its action on bone\par
and kidney, but that this action is not necessarily\par
related directly to the production\par
of m-rna.\par

that the antagonistic effect of the\par
adrenal cortical steroids was expressed\par

the effects of experimental hyper- and\par

distribution of electrolytes and tissue\par
exchangeability with ca and mg were studied\par
in dogs following acute renal pedicle\par

of mg and inorganic p as\par
well as ca were increased.  a greater accumulation\par
of ca occurred in some tissues\par
and a lesser accumulation in others than\par
in acute hypercalcemia of comparable\par
severity and the fractional rate of exchange\par
of tissue ca was 30% more rapid than\par
in control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.\par
bone exchange of ca was not significantly\par
increased.  cell mg concentrations were\par
not appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidism\par
except for a significant 9% decrease\par
in myocardium, but the fractional rate\par
of exchange of tissue mg was increased.\par
acidsoluble p concentrations were decreased\par
in 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrations\par
were decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.\par
in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to a\par
decreased plasma ca, the increment\par
in plasma inorganic p that usually occurs\par
after renal pedicle ligation was 75% less\par
than in control dogs.  cell ca concentrations\par
were decreased by 10-40% but the\par
fractional rate of exchange of tissue ca was\par
unaltered.  although cell mg concentrations\par
were unaltered a 40% increase occurred\par
in the exchangeability of skeletal muscle\par
mg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations were\par
decreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has been\par
previously reported that hypercalcemia\par
increases cell ca concentrations by raising\par
the extracellular ca concentration gradient.\par
evidence has also been presented that\par
hypercalcemia directly inhibits cell\par
influx of mg and na and cell efflux of\par
k.  with altered parathyroid activity, 2 types\par
of effects are observed: those which are\par
dependent upon an abnormal extracellular\par
ca concentration and those which appear to\par
be due to intrinsic effects of parathormone\par
on cell cation transport.  the present\par
data are compatible with the hypotheses\par
that parathormone stimulates bidirectional\par
transport of cell ca and p, stimulates\par
cell influx of mg and opposes the effects of\par
hypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.\par

   parathyroid hormone administered\par
in vivo to rabbits\par
produced a metabolic alteration\par

mitochondria, evidenced by\par
diminished respiratory rate,\par
respiratory control, and p:o\par
ratio with a series of substrates\par
including pyruvate plus\par
fumarate, succinate,\par
ketoglutarate, malate, citrate,\par

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical survey\par
of the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.\par
   a collection has been made of 134 personal and\par
published cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in which\par
adequate information was available concerning the\par
pathological state of the bones.  measurements were\par
available of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, and\par
blood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonate\par
and plasma proteins in a representative sample.\par
the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the whole\par
series of 134 cases were not related reciprocally but\par
were correlated directly.  these data were further analyzed\par
by allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,\par
according to the type of pathological lesions present in\par
the bones.  in one group there was evidence of defective\par
mineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of either\par
rickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium was\par
found to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other group\par
there was no primary defect of mineralization but the\par
lesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present and\par
the plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there was\par
no significant correlation between the plasma levels of\par
calcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasma\par
phosphate was significantly higher in the group with\par
the higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate that\par
in patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to general\par
belief, the plasma calcium varies independently of the\par
plasma phosphate.  since these results imply differences\par
in parathyroid function among patients with azotemic\par
osteodystrophy, a survey has also been made of\par
the recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.\par
generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normal\par
levels of plasma calcium are associated with greater\par
parathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most cases\par
of chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.\par
the various data are interpreted in relation\par
to the known metabolic disturbances and natural history\par
of azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states of\par
simple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemia\par
and relative unresponsiveness to the calcemic\par
action of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquired\par
resistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statistically\par
normal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroid\par
glands can function effectively in some patients\par
with chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level of\par
the plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and the\par
effects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of this\par
group suggest that the normal plasma calcium results\par
from an increased production of parathyroid hormone.\par
the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,\par
as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could mean\par
that the development of an effective degree of secondary\par
hyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of the\par
renal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroid\par
response is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamin\par
d resistance it also entails the development of generalized\par
osteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralization\par
and increased liability to metastatic calcification.\par

these new observations indicated cellular\par
defects in bone remodeling shared by the propositus and\par

on the ca transport system, rather than on the stimulatory\par
effect of vit d.  this inhibitory effect of actinomycin d on\par
ca transport is present within 3 hr of its s. c. injection\par

diagnostic evidence was a marked degree of growth retardation\par
accompanied by a pronounced delay in skeletal\par
maturation, and, in most cases, signs of secondary\par
hypothyroidism, increased insulin sensitivity, and a\par
poor response to metopyrone administration.  none of\par

growth, about 6 cm./year, was obtained.  there was no\par

any of the patients.  none of them has so far become resistant\par

test of growth hormone reserve.  all patients\par
exhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion,\par
as indicated by the failure of this hormone to rise\par
to normal levels in response to hypoglycemia.  the order\par
of frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone,\par
gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid\par
stimulating hormone.  no pattern of deficiency was characteristic\par
for any particular etiology of hypopituitarism.\par
one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sella\par
turcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated loss\par
of growth hormone secretory capacity.  two patients in\par
the series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroid\par
as well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevated\par
liters of antithyroid antibodies.  this study represents\par
the first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay of\par
growth hormone function in a series of hypopituitary\par
adults.  it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalence\par
of growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growth\par
hormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of the\par
most sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.\par

hypoglycemia and dwarfism associated with the isolated\par
deficiency of growth hormone.\par
the authors have studied a 7-year-old dwarfed\par
boy with a history of severe, recurrent\par
hypoglycemic episodes since age 1 and\par
retarded bone age.  hepatic, adrenal,\par
and thyroid function were normal.  he demonstrated\par
fasting hypoglycemia with blood\par
sugars of 30-40 mg./100 ml.  he was not sensitive\par
to l-leucine but showed insulin\par
sensitivity and hypoglycemic unresponsiveness.\par
glycogenolysis in response to both\par
adrenaline and glucagon was appropriate.  fasting\par
plasma gh levels were less than\par
1 m g./ml. (normal 1-3), and no rise was seen\par
after insulin-induced hypoglycemia.\par
similarly, these low gh levels did not rise 3-6\par
hr.  after a glucose tolerance test.\par
treatment with hgh reversed the alterations\par
in carbohydrate metabolism.  it is\par
concluded that the patient suffered from an isolated\par
gh deficiency which resulted in\par
dwarfism and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism.\par

the effect of growth hormone in hypothalamo-pituitary\par

human growth hormone, isolated by raben's\par
method, was given in 2 to 5 mg. daily\par
doses over periods from 1 to 12 days to 7 patients\par
with pituitary-hypothalamic dwarfism.\par
the metabolic effects were as follows:\par
nitrogen retention with a variable\par
reduction in blood urea.  the plasma amino-acid\par
concentration did not alter after\par
i.m. injection of the hormone during fasting.\par
an accompanying retention of intracellular\par
components, in such proportions required\par
for protoplasm formation.\par
isotonic expansion of the extracellular compartment,\par
without change in the plasma\par
electrolyte concentrations.  retention of phosphorus,\par
sometimes a rise in plasma\par
phosphate; increased intestinal calcium absorption,\par
hypercalciuria, no alteration\par
in plasma calcium; an increase in plasma citrate\par
and citrate urinary excretion;\par
the calcium and phosphate retention was reversed\par
on stopping treatment.  mobilisation\par
of fat stores with lipid catabolism: this\par
was accompanied by a well marked\par
increase in nefa concentration for some hours\par
after hormone injection in the\par
fasting state, after a period of hypoglycaemia\par
and low nefa levels.  a complex,\par
biphasic action on glucose metabolism.  fasting\par
blood sugar levels are altered,\par
as are the glycaemia in various tests such as\par
fasting, insulin injections, tolbutamide\par
administration, intestinal hyperglycaemia.\par
acceleration of intermediate\par
metabolism with increased blood citrate\par
concentrations and 24 hours urinary\par
excretion of  -ketoglutaric acid.  in one test\par
during fasting the blood citrate increased\par
4 hours after hormone injection.  after\par
an oral load of sugar the blood citrate\par
and  -ketoglutaric acid concentrations\par
did not alter.  a progressive gain in\par
weight has been found during treatment, partly\par
reversible on stopping treatment,\par
correlating with the intracellular nitrogen retention\par
and expansion of the extracellular\par
space, despite mobilisation of fat reserves.\par

serum chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' and serum pituitary\par
growth hormone in mother and fetus at term.\par
chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' (cgp) and\par
pituitary hgh were measured in\par
maternal and fetal blood obtained simultaneously\par
at term from 29 pregnant women\par
and their fetuses utilizing sensitive radioimmunoassay\par
procedures.  the mean concentration\par
of serum cgp in maternal venous blood\par
was 5.6  g/ml (sem0.39) whereas\par
in umbilical venous serum the mean concentration\par
was 0.019  g/ml (sem 0.003),\par
a 300-fold difference.  contrariwise, the mean\par
concentration of serum hgh in maternal\par
serum was 5.9 m g/ml (sem 0.52) and\par
in umbilical venous serum the level\par
was 33.5 m g/ml (sem 4.6).  the ratio of serum\par
cgp/hgh in maternal venous serum\par
was 1076 in contrast to 0.57 in umbilical venous\par
serum.  the findings strongly suggest\par
that cgp is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast\par
almost exclusively in a unidirectional\par
manner into the maternal circulation.\par
further, it is unlikely that an appreciable\par
exchange of hgh occurs between the\par
maternal and fetal circulations.  the\par
data support the view that the growth hormone-like\par
metabolic changes observed in\par
pregnancy are attributable to the effects of cgp\par
and are consistent with the hypothesis\par
that cgp is an important metabolic hormone\par
of pregnancy exerting its actions\par
on the mother and possibly the placenta, but only\par
indirectly on the fetus.\par

effect of abdominal operation on glucose tolerance and serum levels of\par

   abdominal operations of moderate severity are\par
followed by high fasting blood-glucose levels and a reduced\par
tolerance to intravenous glucose which persists\par
for at least 72 hours after operation.  fasting plasma-insulin\par
levels are raised after surgery.  intravenous glucose\par
produces much higher levels of serum-insulin and\par
growth hormone in the immediate postoperative period.\par
corticotrophin infusion increases the plasma-hydrocortisone\par

plasma growth hormone concentration in the rat determined by\par

hypophysectomy and extrasellar pituitary transplants.\par
   the assay used is described in detail.  several experimental\par
conditions were studied, both to validate the\par
method and to determine factors which regulate gh secretion\par
in this species.  in fasting sprague-dawley rats\par
weighing 150-200 g, mean plasma gh concentration in\par
females was 94.2 17.3, and in males, 54.9 12.0 m\par
g/ml.  gh levels in lactating rats were determined to be in\par
the normal range for females, thereby providing evidence\par
that this assay does not detect prolactin.  gh levels were\par
not elevated in pregnant rats.  hypophysectomy led to a\par
fall below detectable levels of gh.  intraocular pituitary\par
transplants failed to raise gh levels in hypophysectomized\par
hosts.  gh levels in male, but not in female, rats\par
are depressed by brief periods of ether anesthesia.  these\par
findings and the results of pituitary transplantation experiments\par
are further evidence that the nervous system\par
is involved in the regulation of gh secretion.\par

clinical features of the alalies (russian).\par
the term 'alalies' is applied to the various\par
states of absence or insufficient development\par
of speech in children, resulting\par
from defective development or affections\par
of the speech centers before the development\par
of speech.  from the clinical\par
study it is possible to distinguish between several\par
forms: motor, sensory, and\par
semantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  the\par
causes are multiple: trauma, perinatal\par
cerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,\par
metabolic disorders before the\par
development of speech, and alimentary and\par
trophic disorders.  the alalies show\par
varying degrees of severity.  in most children\par
suffering from alaly, neurological\par
signs can be demonstrated on the right side,\par
an indication of the organic nature of\par
the condition.  the presence of local symptoms\par
in the various forms of alaly is\par
often associated with signs indicating involvement\par
of adjacent regions of the cerebral\par
hemispheres in the pathological process\par
which would explain why the alalies\par
are often complex.  the character of the alalies\par
depends on functional disorders\par
resulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,\par
motor, temporal or parietal\par
region of the dominant cerebral hemisphere.\par
patients with alaly often show neurotic\par
reactions, resulting from the disorders\par
of the processes of inhibition and excitation\par
of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical\par
formations.  early treatment of\par
the alalies with drugs combined with logopedic\par
and pedagogic measures gives good results.\par

the applicability of individualized programed instruction\par
in the education of deaf children.\par
verbal behavior is learned behavior and as\par
such is guided by the same principles\par
as any other learned behavior.  the parents'\par
role is mainly to help the young deaf\par
child conceive of language as a socializing\par
process and to help shape language behavior\par
toward the use of verbal symbols.\par
the teacher's role in the deaf child's\par
progress as a language user includes (1) helping\par
the child discover how the structure\par
of his language operates and (2) guiding\par
him in the process of acquiring clear\par
concepts.  the learning of a language is a highly\par
individualized process and requires\par
thousands of hours of practice.  efficiency\par
in language teaching to the deaf\par
has not been generally achieved by traditional\par
methods.  the teacher of the deaf\par
needs extra help in order to provide the individualistic\par
kind of teaching to insure\par
verbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoring\par
programed materials offer this\par
help.  programs are so constructed that a child\par
proceeds through the program step\par
by step with a probability of maximum success\par
because of constant feedback as to\par
correctness of his responses.  for younger\par
children the use of a machine seems\par
desirable while for older children the program\par
may appear in book form, on film\par
strip, and any other visual medium.  well constructed\par
programs should be correlated\par

speech and reading problems in childhood.\par
the following communicative disorders\par
have been discussed: functional articulation\par
defects, delayed speech development,\par
stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate,\par
neurological disorders, and reading disorders.\par
these disorders rarely have a\par
single cause.  they are the result of an\par
intermingling of many factors, some physiological\par
and some psychological, some\par
residing within the child and some in the\par
parents and environment in general.  delayed\par
or defective speech is a cause for\par
great concern to most parents and teachers.\par
the public health worker who listens\par
with an attentive and sympathetic ear may\par
allay some of this anxiety and thus help\par
foster healthy emotional development in\par
the child.  the existence of a more serious\par
condition underlying the presenting communication\par
problem, even if sensed by the\par
parents, is frequently denied.  the public\par
health worker can assist the parents in\par
the painful process of facing up to their\par
fears.  a child with a communication problem\par
is still a child and the public health worker\par
by simply reflecting this to the parents\par
and advising them on normal child-raising\par
practices can, again, be of help to the\par
child.  children with speech deviations are\par
exposed to an overabundance of well-intentioned\par
speech correction at home.\par
most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunately\par
is harmful.  while the worker\par
may not be in a position to offer specific\par
advice on a particular child, the manner\par
in which the parents and teacher are handling\par
the child's communication problem\par
can be explored and damaging practices\par
possibly eliminated.  the fact that there\par
may be a diagnostic and treatment center\par
to which the child can be referred does\par
not vitiate the public health worker's role.\par
the public health physician and public health\par
nurse have a valuable contribution\par
to make in helping the parents, school,\par
and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.\par

course of the disorder; (3) prospects of the\par
level of intellectual performance in the\par
future of the children.  in 13 cases, cerebral\par
damage had resulted from traumatic\par
contusion; in 10 cases from an intracranial\par
nontraumatic hematoma (vascular malformation,\par
aneurysm or angioma); in 2 cases\par

the causes of delayed development of speech.\par
speech develops parallelly and simultaneously\par

all children are given the chance to develop\par
in favorable conditions and to pass through\par
all the phases of development without some\par
injury.  the various possibilities when a\par
child may be injured and hampered in the\par
development of speech are discussed.  the\par
testing of the sense of hearing in children\par
with a cleft palate is also included-out of\par
181 cases of cleft palate, in 72 cases there\par
was decrease of the sense of hearing exceeding\par
30 db.  this additional injury of\par
the child with a cleft palate, if remaining unnoticed,\par
may make the treatment of speech\par
abnormality difficult.  the necessity of\par
diagnostic team investigation and the treatment\par
of children with speech disturbances\par

influence has not been shown for other types\par

the purpose of this experiment was\par
to investigate the effects of stimulus\par
pretraining on concept learning by subjects\par
who had a 'high risk' of being classified\par
as mentally retarded at some future time.\par
a group of 27 'higher risk' and 27 'lower\par
risk' subjects was randomly divided into\par

the stimuli used for transfer task 1, subjects\par
in each group were presented with a\par
concept learning task (transfer task 1).\par
after reaching the criterion of learning on\par
transfer task 1, subjects were presented\par

deaf students consistently earned higher speech\par
grades than their right-handed-left-sighting\par

matched on the basis of\par

inhibition could only be detected when growth\par
was followed by daily plate counts.  maximal\par
growth was delayed for about 24 hr by\par
the horse serum, and the inhibition was\par
spontaneously reversed at the temperature\par
of incubation.  penicillin g was also found\par

when 1,000 units/ml was present.  the\par
survival of m. neurolyticum at undetectable\par
levels in cultures during the incubation\par
period presented an 'eclipse' phenomenon\par

hela cells resistant to bromodeoxyuridine and deficient in thymidine\par
kinase activity.\par
mutant sublines of hela s3 cells resistant\par
to growth inhibition by bromodeoxyuridine\par
(budr) have been isolated.  the resistant\par
cell lines (hela bu-10, hela bu-15,\par
hela bu-25, hela bu-50, and hela bu-100)\par
proliferated in the presence of 10,\par
15,25,50, and 100 mg/ml budr, respectively.\par
extracts from hela bu-25, hela\par
bu-50, and hela bu-100 cells exhibited\par
2-5% of the thymidine-h, deoxyuridine-h,\par
and bromodeoxyuridine-h phosphorylating\par
activities of parental hela s3 cells.\par
hela bu-10 and hela bu-15 cell extracts\par
were also deficient in thymidine kinase\par
activity, yielding approx. 43% and 8%,\par
respectively, the thymidine kinase activity\par
of parental hela s3 cells.  the deficiency\par
in thymidine kinase activity of hela bu-100\par
cells was not due to negative feedback inhibition\par
by high levels of budr or to interference\par
with the thymidine kinase assay by\par
inhibitors or competing enzymes in the\par
hela bu-100 cell extracts.  following 5 weekly\par
passages in media lacking budr,\par
the hela bu-100 cells did not exhibit increased\par
thymidine kinase activity.  moreover,\par
mixtures of extracts from hela s3\par
and hela bu-100 cells displayed a thymidine\par
kinase activity equivalent to the sum\par
of the activities or extracts prepared,\par
respectively, from the hela s3 and hela\par
bu-100 cells.  radioautographic studies\par
have shown that after hela s3 cells were\par
incubated for 6 hr with thymidine-h,\par
35-45% of the nuclei were heavily labeled\par
with radioactivity.  however, fewer hela\par
bu-100 cells displayed labeled nuclei and\par
the nuclei were only lightly labeled.\par
hela bu-100 cell extracts contained normal\par
amounts of thymidylate synthetase,\par
thymidilate kinase, and uridine kinase activities.\par
following infection by vaccinia\par

were induced in hela bu-100 cells.\par

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero and\par
in vitro with rubella virus.\par
a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomes\par
was undertaken to determine if damage\par
to the genetic apparatus of human cells may\par
be induced by rubella virus and whether\par
such damage produces the pathology seen\par
in newborns from mothers infected early\par
in pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains were\par
initiated in vitro from embryonic material\par
obtained by therapeutic abortion of fetuses\par
from rubella-infected mothers.  embryonic\par
material from spontaneous and non-rubella\par
therapeutic abortions yielded similar\par
cell strains for infection in vitro.  the\par
results from both types of studies were as\par
follows: (a) virus shedding cell strains were\par
obtained from all types of organs cultivated,\par
which indicated wide dissemination\par
of virus in the fetuses from rubella-infected\par
mothers.  (b) chronic infection could\par
readily be established by in vitro infection\par
and no cytopathic effect was noted.\par
(c) although many strains continued to shed\par
virus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,\par
no changes in growth properties\par
occurred with the exception that infected\par
strains from lung tissue showed limited\par
growth capacities.  (d) from observations\par
of over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious\par
chromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional\par
changes were observed in\par
strains infected naturally or experimentally.\par
(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived\par
cell strains there was a marked elevation\par
in frequency of chromosome breakage in\par
3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlation\par
between virus shedding in vitro and\par
increased chromosome breakage was noted\par
although this was not complete.  (g) the\par
combined average frequency of chromosome\par
breakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortion\par
strains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortus\par
strains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,\par
but significant elevation in average chromosome\par
break frequency (9.8%) was obtained\par
in four cell strains which had been experimentally\par
infected in vitro with rubella virus\par
(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effects\par
upon the chromosomes were demonstrated,\par
these were restricted to slight general elevations\par
in frequency of breakage above\par
normal values.  very high increases in breaks\par
were sporadic.  it appears more likely\par
that the general fetal abnormalities associated\par
with rubella infection in vivo result\par
from possible effects of the virus upon growth\par
rather than from effects upon the\par
chromosomes.  however, the studies were\par
restricted to fibroblasts cultured in\par
vitro; and effects on other types of cells\par
may have greater implications for this\par
question.\par

fine structure of staphylococccal l-forms.\par
   l forms of staph. aureus and bacterial cells were\par

ultrathin sections allowed comparison of structural units\par
and indicated that staphylococcal l form units of all\par
sizes lack the rigid cell wall and the compact, fibrillar\par
nuclear area of bacterial cells.  the l form units are\par
bound by a typical 'trilamellar' membrane comparable\par
to that described for mycoplasma species.  nuclear\par
areas in staphylococcal l forms present a diffuse appearance\par
and could not be correlated with size of any\par
particular structural unit.  many small units were seen\par
within large bodies and possibly are involved in the reproductive\par

respiratory virus vaccines. ii. mycoplasma pneumoniae (eaton agent)\par
vaccines.\par
   purified and concentrated formalin-killed vaccines\par
were prepared from m. pneumoniae propagated in\par
serum-free artificial medium.  the vaccines were\par
aqueous or were incorporated in alum or emulsified\par
peanut oil (adjuvant 65) adjuvant.  two or 3 different\par
concentrations of mycoplasma were included in each\par
preparation.  serum neutralizing and cf antibody responses\par
were measured in hamsters, monkeys, and in\par
institutionalized persons following 1,2,3 and sometimes\par
4 vaccinations.  all of the preparations were\par
highly antigenic in animals and in man.  alum vaccines\par
were better than aqueous vaccines and those in adjuvant\par
65 appeared to give best results although the bleeding\par
times were not always optimal for demonstrating\par
maximal effect.  persons who were without detectable\par
antibody initially and thus would be most vulnerable to\par
infection gave better responses to the vaccine than did\par
those with pre-existing antibody.  alum vaccine is an\par
acceptable formulation for use in man, and only 2 doses\par
of such vaccine were necessary to induce neutralizing\par
antibody in 90% of the persons who were initially without\par
detectable antibody.  no local or systemic reaction\par
of clinical consequence was noted in any of the persons\par
vaccinated.  recent unpublished findings, which indicate\par
a high degree of effectiveness of the alum vaccine\par
in stimulating antibody in preschool children and in\par
protecting children and adults against the natural disease,\par

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratory\par
infections.\par
isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputum\par
was attempted in 254 patients with various syndrome\par
of respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% of\par
the 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients with\par
chronic bronchial diseases who were not treated with\par
tetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratory\par
infection.  these differences are not statistically\par
significant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for\par
m. pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains most\par
frequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolation\par
was from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of\par
m. pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is not\par
useful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates the\par
prevalence of infection, especially if patients have received\par
tetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation\par
(cf) was the most specific.  the growth\par
inhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and was\par
significantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 tests\par
may measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.\par
serum cold agglutinins developed in many cases\par
of pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologic\par
diagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in a\par
minimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patients\par
hospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.\par
serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare in\par
lobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniae\par
accounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidence\par
of m. pneumoniae infection was constant in\par
different seasons but greatest relative to the occurrence\par
of pneumonia in the fall and spring.\par

color test for the measurement of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas.\par
   a metabolic inhibition technique for the measurement\par
of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas was developed,\par
based upon the ability of t-strain mycoplasmas to\par
metabolize urea with the concomitant production of ammonia,\par
and the ability of specific, antiserum to inhibit\par
this ammonia production.  phenol red added to the\par
medium served as an indicator of ph change resulting\par
from ammonia production.  specific antiserum to t-strain\par
mycoplasma t-960 was prepared.  the t-strain\par
organism was shown to be serologically distinct from the\par
recognized large-colony mycoplasmas.  antibody to\par
mycoplasma strain t-960 in human sera was demonstrated\par

1, the negroni agent, and the f12 mycoplasma were\par
used for infection of l cells, and m. hominis 1 and\par

were capable of multiplication in the culture systems\par
employed.  none produced detectable levels of interferon,\par
and responsiveness of the cells to induction of interferon\par

artificial medium and in tissue culture.\par
mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemic\par
patient, was studied in broth\par
cultures and in several cell culture lines.\par
this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphism\par
in size, internal structure, and\par
shape, including forms with filamentous\par
projections.  the most common form observed\par
was 0.5 to 1 in diameter and\par
had a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probably\par
dna.  the cytoplasm of the organisms\par
contained ribosome-like granules and\par
a flattened vacuole which indented the\par
nuclear area.  there were various other forms,\par
including 'elementary bodies' 100m\par
in diameter that were very electron-dense.\par
in the tissue culture lines in which\par
the cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasma\par
were closely associated with the\par
cell surface and were occasionally seen in\par
membrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.\par
in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,\par
the mycoplasma were fewer and not\par
attached to the cell surface.  although the\par
ultrastructure of this strain is similar\par
to that of previously described strains, there\par
are differences in details of structure\par
which may be related either to the growth\par
conditions used or to characteristics of\par
the strain.  the various forms of the organism\par
are consistent with the suggestion\par
that mycoplasma may have several mechanisms\par
of reproduction (growth).  the intracellular\par
mycoplasma may be protected from\par
antibiotics.  this would partly explain\par
the difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma from\par
infected cell cultures.\par

long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic children\par
to drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.\par
   it is evident from this study that treatment and\par
control groups must be matched for severity of illness,\par
since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacological\par
as well as to other types of treatments.  the use of\par
the double-blind technique does not of itself guarantee\par
a well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or more\par
treatment regimes may be misleading if the groups are\par
not matched, or if the matching is not based on critical\par
factors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologic\par
aspects of treatment and the type of\par
response to the drug itself were related to the initial\par
severity of language impairment.  thus the major developmental\par
defect which determines long-term outcome\par
for schizophrenic children in this group also predicted\par
the immediate responsiveness to treatment.  within the\par
2 major prognostic subgroups of young schizophrenic\par
children, those with speech and those without, are children\par
with different profiles of disordered development\par
and different patterns of assets and handicaps.\par

disturbed children.  underlining the well-known\par
importance of the therapeutic milieu in the treatment\par
and care of the mentally ill particularly important when\par
the patients are children.  the child presented was diagnosed,\par

psychosis, of the autistic type.  the unusually rich data\par
at disposal were obtained through non-verbal communication,\par
because the child has no language.  nevertheless,\par
he can express himself clearly through play and gestures.\par
the analysis of this precious clinical material focuses\par
the discussion on the existence and the quality of\par
an object-relationship preceding the psychosis, the importance\par
of the 'early unusual sensitivities' in the formation\par

the problems of infantile autism and psychiatric nosology.\par
in psychiatric literature the syndrome of\par
early infantile autism has been divided\par
into several subgroups (as, for instance,\par
the subgroup of kanner and the subgroup\par
of asperger) and has been assigned to\par
different mental conditions (schizophrenia,\par
psychopathy, neurosis).  these distinctions\par
and classifications are thought to be\par
controversial, so long as the etiology of\par
early infantile autism is unknown.  nor\par
should any 'psychiatric school' claim to\par
have the 'right' concept of schizophrenia,\par
since the etiology of schizophrenia, too,\par
has not yet been discovered.  in this particular\par
'pre-scientific' situation of psychiatry\par
it seems more promising to analyze\par
the individual mental case and to concentrate\par
on clinical symptomatology instead\par
of discussing arbitrary 'nosological entities'.\par

(1) educational level of parents; (2)\par
occupational level of father; (3) prevalence\par
of broken homes; (4) male-female ratio\par
in each patient group; (5) ordinal position\par
among siblings; (6) ordinal position\par
among siblings of same sex; and (7) age of\par
parents at birth of child.  results indicated\par

as autistic or symbiotic show many\par
similarities to those with the diagnosis of\par
chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia.\par
in general, the parents in these 2 groups\par
were better educated and were employed\par
in more highly rated occupations than parents\par
of otherwise disturbed subjects.\par
broken homes were prevalent in the group\par
of disturbed nonschizophrenic children,\par
but not in the autistic or chronic undifferentiated\par
schizophrenic groups.  the male-female\par

into: (1) childhood schizophrenia, (2)\par
organic states with psychosis, (3) mental\par
subnormality with psychosis, (4) sensory\par
deprivation, (5) neurosis, and (6) manic-depressive\par

interpretation of incomplete psychological test findings,\par
especially in regard to prognosis.  the results of this\par
study offer guidelines for differential diagnosis between\par
psychosis resulting from primary emotional disorders\par
and psychosis superimposed on a chronic brain syndrome\par
in children.  questions are raised about early infantile\par
autism as a unitary syndrome on the basis of etiology.\par
the need for a better and more comprehensive diagnostic\par
classification of the psychotic reactions of infancy and\par

modification of autistic behavior with lsd-25.\par
   lsd-25 appears to offer a useful adjunct to the\par
psychotherapy of autistic children because of its positive\par
effect in areas which are closely related to the process\par
of psychotherapy.  a pair of identical male autistic twins\par
was periodically administered 50 of lsd-25 and\par
observed for behavior changes.  control and drug observations\par
were made while the subjects were placed in a series\par
of standard test situations referred to as the socialization\par
test, social isolation test, peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake,\par
face-to-face, hand-holding and following tests.\par
diverse behaviors were recorded in the areas of self-stimulatory\par
behavior, social interaction and affect.\par
recordings were made using an esterline angus multiple\par
pen recorder.  all behaviors were measured in total time\par
appearance and plotted as percent time in appearance.\par

the influence of organic and emotional factors on the origins, nature\par
and outcome of childhood psychosis.\par
a group of 65 children diagnosed as 'child\par
psychosis' (or one of its synonyms)\par
was followed up for an average of 15 yr.\par
none of the parents were schizophrenic;\par
6 (10%) had a parent who had psychiatric\par
treatment for neurosis.  only 2 children\par
had a sib with transient autistic episode.\par
none had sibs with the adult type of\par
schizophrenia.  these findings are felt to\par
militate against the view that child\par
psychosis is part of the schizophrenic group.\par
among the 65 children: 40% had an\par
i.q. below 50, 40% between 50 and 80 and\par
only 20% above 80.  the i.q. was found\par
in general to be a good predictor of later\par
performances.  mental retardation is\par
regarded as a primary component of the\par
clinical picture.  evidence of brain damage\par
was conclusive in 15 children (24%) who showed\par
epileptic attacks (developing in 10\par
of them during the follow-up).  speech disorders\par
were the most outstanding manifestation.\par
five children had confirmed receptive\par
aphasia and 14 others show some\par
evidence of it.  in 75% of the speaking children\par
echolalia was noted; 11% had abnormalities\par
of delivering spoken words.  the\par
view that reduction of speech is due\par
to social withdrawal is rejected.  psychogenic\par
factors and parental attitude were\par
not found to be relevant to the etiology.  the\par
psychosis is not considered primarily\par
emotional in origin, although emotional\par
relationships as well as educational management\par
have considerable influence on the\par
outcome of the disease.\par

compliance and resistance in the conditioning of autistic children:\par
an exploratory study.\par
twelve autistic children between 4 and 9 yr\par
of age were asked to choose red objects\par
and square objects from a stimulus array.\par
ten subjects made correct choices\par
significantly less often than chance, that is,\par
they avoided emitting correct responses.\par
the subjects were given 60 conditioning\par
trials in which choices of either red or\par
square objects were reinforced.  those who\par
attained either concept subsequently\par
performed perfectly when asked to produce\par
both red and square concepts; the other\par
subjects continued giving fewer-than-chance\par
correct responses.  thus, conditioning\par
trials elicited in some subjects an increased\par
tendency to comply with the experimenter's\par
instructions.  the results suggest\par

were rewarded for closer and closer\par
reproductions of the attending adults' speech.\par

selected, as the result of matching, with regard to age\par
of onset, culture, and family organization.  intactness\par
of the family structure was required.  residential treatment\par
implied round-the-clock therapeutic interaction\par
with the child for 7 days each week, 12 mth of the year.\par
day treatment consisted of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. care\par
5 days a week for 9 mth of the year.  staff distribution\par
was identical in the 2 groups, but in the day-care group\par
the teacher assumed a larger relative position in the\par

in ego status at the beginning of the experiment\par
by means of the wisc and psychiatric evaluation,\par
changes in this status being measured by the wisc and\par
the metropolitan achievement test series.  the results\par
indicated no significant improvement in either day or\par
residence in those schizophrenic children who, on admission\par
had unscorable wisc tests and who were the\par
most severely impaired in ego structure.  among the\par
children scorable on the wisc, the organic groups in\par
day and in residential treatment showed equivalent degrees\par
of progress, the non-organic children in residence\par
gave evidence of more improvement than did the\par

visual versus tactual receptor preference in normal and schizophrenic\par
children.\par
   receptor preferences between visual or tactual\par
stimuli were measured in schizophrenic and normal\par
children; 4 pairs of standardized choice situations between\par
visual or tactual stimuli were used, with the time\par
of engagement with either stimulus constituting the\par
preference measure.  schizophrenic children between the\par
ages of 7 and 9 were compared with same aged normal\par
children.  a group of retardates were used for ma control.\par
schizophrenics were significantly lower in visual\par
preference than the same aged normals, and an age trend\par
for increased visual preference was found in the normal\par
sample.  retardates showed greater visual preference\par
than schizophrenics of comparable ma.  some implications\par

the effect of folic acid on growth and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis\par
in the rat kidney.\par
   the effect of a single injection of folic acid (250\par
mg/kg of body wt) on growth of the rat kidney was studied.\par
the patterns of the response were found to be essentially\par
similar in animals aged between 3 wk and 12\par
mth.  maximum values of kidney weight and nucleic acid content,\par
relative to body weight, were found at 4 days at\par
folate administration.  the increases in wet and dry\par
weights at this time were approx. 80% and 30%\par
resp. above the control weights, and the percentage dry matter\par
of the kidney was significantly lower than normal during\par
this period.  at 4 days the rna content of the kidney was\par
also maximal, being about 90% greater than the control\par
value, and the dna content after 4 days was increased\par
by about 60%.  whereas the dna values in 6-wk-old rats\par
were slightly lower at 7 and 10 days than at 4 days, in\par
12-mth-old animals a further small increase was observed\par
at 7 days, suggesting a prolongation of dna synthesis\par
in the older animals.  autoradiographic studies of\par
dna synthesis with thymidine-h have shown a greatly\par
increased labeling index in all zones of the kidney following\par
folate injection.  maximum values were observed\par
at 48 hr in the cortical zone, but the patterns of the\par
changes in the medulla were less well defined.  the labelling\par
indices in the kidneys of 12-mth-old rats remained\par
above normal for a longer period than in 6-wk-old rats.\par
these results concur with the evidence of an increased\par
dna contents of the kidneys of older rats between 4 and\par
7 days after folate.\par

renal renin in unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive rats.\par
juxtaglomerular index, renal pressor\par
activity and width of the zona glomerulosa\par
were normal in unilaterally nephrectomized\par
hypertensive rats maintained on a normal\par
sodium intake, increased in those\par
subjected to sodium depletion and decreased\par
in those receiving 1% saline.  this indicates\par
that renin formation and secretion are\par
most likely the result of the sodium state\par
of the animal rather than loss of a renin-stimulating\par
agent in the contralateral or\par
unclipped kidney.  failure of sodium to influence\par
the degree of hypertension in\par

effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatory\par

   the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatory\par

nephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and those\par
receiving replacement therapy and was compared to the\par
rch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterally\par
nephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the latter\par
group there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2\par
which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.\par
in the hypophysectomized group without replacement\par
therapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48\par
hrs.  however, instead of the rch continuing there was a\par
regression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequent\par
change at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized group\par
receiving hormone replacement there was an initial\par
rch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the further\par
renal enlargement at 10 days was much less than that\par
of the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results of\par
this experiment and of other reported studies imply\par
existence of a renotropic factor which is not produced\par
in the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitary\par
for full effectiveness.\par

extrarenal fibromuscular hyperplasia.\par
   clinical, radiologic, and pathologic studies on\par
19 patients with lesions in the extrarenal arteries that\par
resembled fibromuscular hyperplasia are described.\par
in 11 patients fibromuscular hyperplasia was present\par
in the renal arteries.  patients with involvement of the\par
celiac artery were the only ones who had symptoms of\par
visceral ischemia.  fibromuscular hyperplasia of the\par
internal carotid arteries was observed in 6 patients, 2\par
of whom had symptoms of cerebral ischemia.  nine patients\par
with fibromuscular hyperplasia of the carotid or\par
renal arteries had intracranial aneurysms, and in 2\par

some speculations on the nature and significance of developmentally\par
small kidneys (renal hypoplasia).\par
renal hypoplasia may take several forms.\par
among these the best known is perhaps\par
renal dysplasia in which the parenchyma\par
is maldeveloped.  other forms of hypoplasia\par
in which the renal parenchyma is normally\par
formed but merely diminished in amount,\par
do exist and may have severe clinical\par
consequences.  the finding at postmortem\par
examination of anatomically small kidneys\par
in children who suffered excessive or\par
unexplained dehydration has prompted the\par
thought that renal tubular insufficiency may\par
result from renal hypoplasia.\par

a study of induced renal hyperplasia using autoradiography.\par
to establish a base line for future\par
autoradiographic investigations, compensatory\par
renal hyperplasia was studied using tritiated\par

in the kidneys remaining after unilateral\par

bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig.\par
bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig is described\par
and is compared with a previous\par
description.  the defect was observed in 19\par
piglets out of a total of 73 born in 8\par
litters, sired by one large white boar.\par
twelve affected piglets died at or soon\par
after birth and 7 died between the ages of 11\par
and 69 days.  inheritance by a simple\par
autosomal recessive factor is suggested by\par
the evidence.  grossly the condition\par
was characterized by varying degrees of\par
hypoplasia and persistence of fetal lobulation.\par
microscopically, the dominant feature\par
was the poor development of the collecting\par
tubule system.  it is concluded that\par
the basic defect is a failure of development\par
of mesonephric mesenchyme.\par

the effect of nortestosterone phenylpropionate on compensatory\par
hypertrophy of the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy.\par
forty-eight hr. after unilateral nephrectomy,\par
both in non-castrated and in castrated\par
male mice the relative dry weight of the\par
remaining kidney increased significantly.\par
this compensatory hypertrophy was significantly\par
stimulated as early as 96 hr. after\par
operation by treatment with 19-nortestosterone\par
phenylpropionate (= npp) at the\par
time of operation.  the percentual increase\par
of the kidney weight was approximately\par
the same in non-castrated as in castrated\par
mice.  the absolute initial values as well\par
as the resulting values 96 hr. after operation\par
were higher in non-castrated male\par
mice than in castrated animals.  the number\par
of cells and the dna concentration per\par
g. tissue decreased during the period of\par
non-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy\par
in both groups of animals.  npp caused a still\par
further decrease.  the concentration\par
of dna per cell did not change.  following\par
non-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy,\par
there was no change in the rna concentration\par
per g. tissue or per cell in castrated\par
mice.  in non-castrated mice the concentration\par
increased.  npp caused approximately\par
the same percentual increase of rna\par
concentration in non-castrated as in\par
castrated animals during the period of compensatory\par
hypertrophy.  the difference between\par
both groups of mice in the rna\par
concentration in the remaining kidney\par
following stimulation of the compensatory\par
hypertrophy by npp was statistically significant.\par

kidney cell proliferation after unilateral nephrectomy as related\par

   the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the\par

thymidine autoradiography in both weanling and\par
adult rats.  among the unoperated control animals,\par
the weanling rat group showed a base line labeling\par
index of 0.59%, and the adult animals, one of 0.11%.\par
the response to unilateral nephrectomy resulted\par
in a peak value of 3.6% in the weanling animals and\par
1.2% in the adult animals, both occurring at 36\par
hr.  mitotic indices were 0.056% in the weanling control\par
animals and 0.0062% in the adults, with a peak\par
of 0.30% and 0.088%, resp., at 36 hr. separate\par
counts of tubule and stromal cells in the cortex\par
revealed that the maximum increase in % labeled cells\par
occurred later in the stromal cells than in the\par
tubule cells; the stromal cells not reaching a\par
maximum until 57 hr after nephrectomy.  the findings\par
indicate that, although the relative proliferative\par

the role of the adrenal glands in controlling\par

drinking fluid was studied using tritiated-thymidine\par
and radioautography.  adrenalectomy\par
alone increased significantly the\par
labeling of the renal cortex and medulla of\par
otherwise intact rats.  two days following\par
unilateral nephrectomy of rats with intact\par
adrenal glands, the number of labeled\par
nuclei in the remaining kidney increased by\par
factors of about 4 and 2.5 in the cortex\par
and the medulla, respectively.  adrenalectomy\par
moderately decreased the hyper-plastic\par
response of the cortex of the remaining\par
kidney, but increased still further\par
the labeling index of the medulla.  by 5 days\par
after unilateral nephrectomy of rats\par
with intact adrenal glands, neither the cortex\par
nor the medulla of the remaining kidney\par
exhibited a marked hyperplastic response.\par

auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the single\par
kidney in the nephrectomized rat.\par
rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,\par
following which the protein metabolism\par
of the other kidney, which exerted\par
a compensatory activity, was studied\par
with h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at different\par
intervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  two\par
phases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acids\par
into the cells of the convoluted\par
tubules were found, with one maximum\par
after 6 hr., at which time the uptake is\par
limited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximum\par
on the 4th day, when the nucleus is\par
equally involved.  in the course of the 2nd\par
phase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,\par
there is also an increased mitotic index\par
of the epithelia of the tubules.  in the\par
collecting tubules, there was only one phase\par
of enhanced amino-acid uptake, with a\par
maximum on the 4th day, also coinciding\par
with an increased mitotic index.  the\par
increase of the number of cells of the kidney\par
was determined by a study of the variations\par
of the mitotic index.  the mean\par
multiplication factor in the beginning amounts\par
to 1.6.  the protein metabolism is increased\par
1.3 times.  the increase of the volume\par
(factor 1.3) and the increase of the protein\par
metabolism per unit of volume (factor 1.3)\par
of the hypertrophic kidney result in a\par
total increase of the protein metabolism\par
of 2.1 times, once the adaptation process\par
is complete, so that the residual kidney\par
has approximately the same protein\par
metabolism as 2 normal kidneys.\par

description of a 5-month-old boy suffering\par
from familial diabetes insipidus.  his\par
sweat as well as that of his mother had an\par
increased nacl content.  chlorthalidone\par
and fursemide had a different effect both\par
on the quantity and on the nacl content of\par
the sweat.  a single dose of chlorthalidone\par
decreased the nacl content for a short\par
time, but increased the quantity of sweat\par
during 3 days.  fursemide given intermittently\par
produced a decrease of the sweat nacl\par
also during the intervals and an increase\par
of the quantity of sweat; however, as a\par
contraregulation during the intervals, the\par
quantity of sweat decreased and at the same\par
time the urea content increased.  from\par
the isotonic serum filtrate in the sweat\par
glands ho and nacl were reabsorbed in\par
the ducts and the urea concentration\par
increased but the reabsorption of ho and nacl\par
did not go parallel, therefore the sweat is\par
hypotonic.  this regulation is altered in\par
diabetes insipidus, therefore the high values\par
of nacl.  without changing the osmolarity,\par
na is exchanged with k.  this mechanism\par
is accentuated if the na-concentration\par
is high.\par

the urine output at a dose of 5 u. 8-hourly,\par

the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.\par
as the water-retaining action of antidiuretic\par
hormone is eliminated in renal diabetes\par
insipidus, the steps in na transport can\par
be separately determined.  vasopressin\par
induced a prompt increase in freewater\par
clearance and urinary volume, as well\par
as a delayed increase in sodium clearance.\par
it is suggested that vasopressin brings\par
about stimulation of sodium reabsorption in\par
the ascending limb of henle's loop.  it\par
is supposed that both physiological actions\par
of antidiuretic hormone - the antidiuretic\par
and the sodium-active effect - become operative\par
in two different places in the nephron\par
and synergistically produce a maximum\par
concentration of urine.\par

the antidiuretic effect of angiotensin in diabetes insipidus.\par
   the effect of angiotensin (val-5-hypertensinii-asp- -amide)\par
was studied in 2 children with diabetes\par
insipidus (a 9 yr old boy with diabetes insipidus neuro-hormonalis\par
and a 4 yr old girl with diabetes insipidus\par
renalis) in whom the clearances of inulin, pah, na and\par
urea and the osmolar and free-water clearances were\par
examined.  angiotensin produces a prompt antidiuresis\par
which is combined with a gross decrease of the na-clearance.\par
the osmolality of the urine is increased only slightly\par
and the free-water clearance does not become negative,\par
both effects being contrary to those seen with vasopressin.\par
the antidiuresis and antinatriuresis can be produced\par
in salt-loaded and salt-deprived states.  furosemide\par
reverses the effects of angiotensin.  the clearance of\par
urea is not changed by angiotensin as long as the glomerular\par
filtration rate remains normal.\par

first group of diabetes insipidus syndrome included 4\par
cases - 3 of idiopathic type and one of the acquired variety\par
due to hand-schuller-christian-disease.  the 4 cases\par
in the second group of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\par
after further investigations were diagnosed as renal\par
acidosis (1 case), other renal tubular syndromes with\par
multiple defects (2 cases), and hypokalaemic nephropathy\par
(1 case).  the third group of polyuria due to chronic renal\par
failure has been exemplified by one case.  the fourth\par
group of 3 cases had compulsive water drinking as the\par
probable etiology.  in addition to the illustrative case\par
histories, a practical diagnostic approach in the context\par
of physiopathology of normal urine excretion has been recommended.\par

without recurrence of the side effects\par
occasionally observed with posterior pituitary\par

pregnant patient was well controlled to term\par
without undesirable uterine stimulation.\par
because of its ease of administration,\par

in the induced disease.  skeletal muscle\par
na increased more than 20% in the familial\par
disease, and the gain involved both cells\par
and environment.  there was no corresponding\par
loss of k.  similar changes of\par
lesser degree were noted in the induced\par

antidiuresis induced by saluretics in diabetes insipidus.\par
in hypothalamus-pituitary and less regularly\par

this adh-like action, not correlated with\par
the extent of the natriuretic action or with\par
salt depletion, depends on a direct effect\par
of the drug on water permeability in the\par
distal tubule and is suppressed by cortisone.\par

neurohypophysial principles in rats with familial hypothalamic\par
diabetes insipidus (brattleboro strain).\par
antidiuretic and oxytocic assays were\par
performed on tissues from 3 female rats with\par
familial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (di)\par
and on 3 normal females.  oxytocic\par
activity was only slightly lower in the pituitaries\par
from the di rats.  antidiuretic activity\par
in the pituitaries from 2 di rats was\par
no more than that expected from their\par
content of oxytocin.  thus, these pituitaries\par
appeared to contain oxytocin but not\par
arginine vasopressin.  the hypothalami from\par
these 2 rats showed minimal antidiuretic\par
activity, which might have been due to\par
oxytocin or vasopressin.  the pituitary\par
from the third di rat contained more antidiuretic\par
activity than could be due to oxytocin.\par
antidiuretic responses to extracts of\par
pituitary and hypothalamus from this\par
rat resembled those produced by arginine\par
vasopressin.  this pituitary appeared to\par
contain about 1/100 the normal amount of\par
vasopressin.  since vasopressin can inhibit\par
diuresis in these di rats, it would appear\par
that they have a specific deficiency of\par
endogenous arginine vasopressin.\par

evaluation of 20 years' experience with the treatment of hydrocephalus\par
in infants.\par
a total of 394 infants were examined between\par
1943 and 1962.  till 1961, 369 infants\par
were examined and 246 were operated on (66.7%);\par
this group is analyzed.  laurence's\par
opinion on the favorable spontaneous\par
evolution is not agreed to and the\par
merits of surgical treatment are proved.  a\par
dynamic form of hydrocephalus in\par
operated infants is shown; the patients who\par
were not operated on suffered from other\par
diseases combined with macrocephaly which\par
must be distinguished from hydrocephalus.\par
a spontaneous arrest of the process\par
was observed in only 14 children,\par
e.g. 3.8%, as compared with laurence's 42.6%.\par
the cause and pathological findings are\par
analyzed in 102 infants operated on between\par
1957 and 1962.  a great discrepancy\par
between the time of the onset of first symptoms\par
and the time of operation was found.\par
this disease manifests itself in 50% of infants\par
in the first month of life, but the average\par
age of infants at the time of operation is\par
6.1 mth.  only 3% of infants are operated\par
on in the first month.  thirteen operating\par
procedures were used in the 20 yr. under\par
review.  until the introduction of deviation of\par
the csf into the jugular vein or into\par
the cardiac atrium, 15.33% of the infants\par
survived 1 yr. after operation.  since the\par
introduction of this procedure the survival\par
rate of infants was 67.8%.  in spite of\par
the late operation about 27% of surviving\par
children showed an average mental\par
development.  surgical treatment of dynamic\par
hydrocephalus is advocated.  they\par

pneumoencephalographic changes in the cavum septi pellucidi and their\par
clinical significance.\par
the pneumoencephalographic appearances and\par
clinical problems associated with\par
communicating and non-communicating cavum\par
septi pellucidi are discussed on the\par
basis of 11 cases.  non-communicating csp\par
may lead to intermittent headaches due\par
to variations of intracranial pressure and\par
obstruction to the flow of csf.  in rare\par
cases, representing a special etiological\par
group, the foramina of monro and the\par
aqueduct may be narrowed.  a communicating\par
csp is generally associated with mild\par
to moderate symmetrical internal hydrocephalus.\par
in the author's opinion this is in\par
most cases a direct result of the cavum, since\par
fluid continues to be formed in the\par
cavum after communication with the rest of\par
the ventricular system has been established.\par
the conditions resemble those in\par
hypersecretory hydrocephalus.  for these\par
reasons the author rejects the view that a\par
communicating csp is of no clinical\par
significance.  in some cases the possibility of a\par
combination of a cavum with a cerebral\par
malformation must be considered.\par

posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies in uncontrolled hydrocephalus.\par
two cases of extensive posterior scalloping\par

additional cases with scalloping of only one\par
lumbar vertebra when partially controlled\par
hydrocephalus has been present for a shorter\par
time are also noted.  no previous\par
association between these entities has been\par
recorded.  it is supposed that the increased\par
intraspinal pressure which must have\par
been present in the first 2 patients for\par
many years, was present near the time of\par
closure of the epiphysis at the junction of\par

air-pantopaque ventriculography in congenital hydrocephalus and\par

a study of the csf pathways by combined pantopaque-air\par
ventriculography in infants\par

is presented.  the advantages\par
of this method are discussed.  combined pantopaque\par

not only a demonstration of the extent of\par
the hydrocephalus but also the exact\par
location and cause of the obstruction.  in infants\par
with myelomeningocele it permits\par
the disclosure of unmanifested hydrocephalus\par
and coexistent intracranial malformations.\par
the early detection of the latter is very\par
important for the complete evaluation,\par
management and prognosis.  the introduction\par
of pantopaque into the ventricular\par
system of infants did not produce an immediate\par
reaction and did not precipitate\par
deterioration of the clinical status.  retention\par
of small amounts of pantopaque in the\par
lateral ventricles did not interfere with the function\par
of bypassing procedures.\par

two cases of dandy walker's syndrome.\par
dandy walker's syndrome refers to a particular\par
kind of malformative hydrocephaly\par
characterized anatomically by association with\par
a more or less considerable agenesis\par
of the cerebellar vermis and with an imperfection\par
of the foramina of luschka and magendie.\par
the dysgenetic nature of this picture is\par
obvious, but the pathogenesis of the\par
hydrocephaly is not simple and the etiology remains\par
obscure.  the malformation is\par
compensated more or less quickly in the life of\par
the subject.  the clinical picture is\par
that of a hydrocephaly by a tumor of the posterior\par
fossa.  the diagnosis can and must\par
be carried out by x-ray examination, the ventriculographic\par
images being pathognomonic.\par
the extreme ease of surgical restoration of\par
the passage of flow and the effectiveness\par
of timely operation emphasize the interest\par
of this syndrome, which turns out to\par
be a rare kind of curable malformative hydrocephaly.\par
the authors report 2 unpublished\par
cases in respect of 3-yr.-old children.  the first,\par
already going back several years\par
(1945) had unfavorable postoperational results.\par
the second (1962) recovered completely,\par

some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatures\par

new information was obtained on the biology\par
of filarial worms from experiments\par
using constrictor constrictor mexicanus\par
boas, infected with macdonaldius oschei\par
worms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei are\par
aperiodic with respect to the light cycle,\par
but fluctuate sharply in density from day\par
to day.  maximum minimum levels occur\par
approx. 2 days apart.  the microfilariae\par
are larger and more variable in size on\par
the days of maximum density than on the\par
days of minimum density.  it is suggested\par
that the smaller microfilariae on the days\par
of low parasitemia are those that have\par
been born recently and that they enlarge\par
during the following 48 hr. before they enter\par
the peripheral capillaries.  low ambient\par
temperatures have little effect upon\par
m. oschei.  exposure of the host to ambient temperatures\par
above 36 c for a period of\par
24-48 hr. appears sufficient to kill adult\par
m. oschei.  all microfilariae apparently die\par
within 144 hr. at this temperature, and in\par
slight infections.  they disappeared from\par
the blood altogether within that period.  microfilariae\par
from an infection 20 times\par
more severe, however, were not eliminated\par
from the circulation prior to the death\par
of the host after 288 hr., although all those\par
observed were either decomposed or\par
distorted and apparently dead.  the indication\par
that the temperature serves as a limiting\par
factor for the parasite at a point several\par
degrees lower than that postulated for\par
the host species, is probably correlated\par
with the nocturnal habits of the host.\par

filariasis in mountain province, luzon, republic of the philippines.\par
an endemic focus of w. bancrofti in mountain\par
province, luzon (calaccad valley),\par
is discussed.  an 11% microfilaremia rate\par
was found.  the parasites were probably\par
brought into this area in the original human\par
migration, as recent immigrants came\par
from non-infected areas.  no infection was\par
found in children under 12 yr. of age,\par
which correlates with spraying of the area\par
since 1953.  however, some people live\par
in unsprayed houses, and children may\par
become infected.  with coming road development\par
and urbanization, culex p. fatigans\par
will move in and undoubtedly increase\par
transmission.  currently anopheles minimus\par
flavirostris is the most important\par
local vector.  aedes (finlaya) niveus was\par
probably also a vector.\par

an antigen for intradermal skin tests was\par
extracted from the homogenate of dirofilaria\par

ph 7.2 and purified by sephadex g-100 gel\par
filtration, cm-cellulose chromatography and\par
deae sephadex a-50 column chromatography.\par
the finally purified antigen, fscd1,\par
was a protein with a small amount of\par

broad band by electrophoresis on cellogel\par
film.  the aminoacids detected by high-voltage\par
paper-electrophoresis of the acid\par
hydrolyzate of the antigen were lysine, arginine,\par
glycine, alanine, glutamic and\par
aspartic acids, and valine.  wheals and an\par

examined in patients with p. westermani,\par

or e. vermicularis, but only weak skin reactions\par
were noticed in all cases.  the\par

purification of antigen for intradermal skin reaction in filariasis.\par
it had been reported that the antigen tca\par
obtained from adult worms of dirofilaria\par
immitis produced noticeable reactions in\par
filariasis patients in whose blood microfilariae\par
could be demonstrated.  further fractionation\par
and purification of this antigen\par
was attempted in order to study the\par
substance responsible for the skin\par
reaction and to obtain a more reliable\par
antigen with high sensitivity and specificity.\par
the fraction fs obtained by treatment\par
similar to that described in\par
the previous report was used as parent material.\par
by gel-filtration and sephadex\par
g-100 column chromatography of antigen fs,\par
antigen fsi, which produced noticeable\par
reactions in the filariasis patients,\par
was obtained.  this highly reactive antigen\par
fsi was separated into 6 fractions, viz.fsc-1,\par
fsc-2, fsc-3, fsc-4, fsc-5 and\par
fsc-6, by cm cellulose chromatography.\par
the 6 antigens were tested at the 1\par
(protein component) level on patients infected\par
with wuchereria bancrofti.  antigen\par
fsc-4, containing 1,500 of protein and\par
40 of carbohydrate per ml., was\par
most active.  next, the further fractionation\par
of antigen fsc-4 by deae-sephadex\par
a50 column chromatography was carried\par
out to yield 4 antigens, viz.fscd-1,\par
fscd-2, fscd-3 and fscd-4.  the 4 antigens\par
were tested at the 0.05 (protein\par
component) level on filariasis patients. antigen\par
fscd-1 produced the most noticeable\par
skin reaction in the patients.  the elimination\par
of protein components from antigen\par
fscd-1 was attempted with nagase (a proteolytic enzyme)\par
and pronase to obtain\par
antigens fscdn and fscdp.  each of\par
these 2 antigens was tested on the patients\par
proved to have filariasis, but the reaction\par
produced by the injection of each antigen\par
was weaker than that produced by antigen\par
fscd-1.  it may be inferred from these\par
studies that the substance responsible for\par
the skin reaction is proteinic.\par

identification of canine microfilariae.\par
the importance of microfilarial identifications\par
in diagnosing canine filariasis was\par
emphasized by comparing the significance of\par
infections due to different species.\par
personal experiences and an analysis of published\par
reports found the modified knott\par
method to be the simplest and most practical\par
of the reliable methods.  its usefulness\par
was improved by new morphologic criteria for\par
differentiating microfilariae.  microfilarial\par
concentrations in peripheral blood from\par
a number of naturally infected dogs\par
were determined.  the average count for 44\par
dogs infected with dirofilaria immitis\par
was only 24,430 (range: < 50 to 168,350) per\par
ml. of blood compared with an average\par
of 235 (range: < 50 to 2,450) per ml. for 100\par

only.  of 38 dogs with inapparent infections\par
of d. immitis, 17 had microfilarial\par
concentrations within the range found for infections\par

incurable cancer may be candidates for specific anti-tumor\par
drug therapy.  the criteria employed for the selection\par
of patients for systemic or regional chemotherapy\par
are reviewed and methods of treatment are outlined.\par
systemic chemotherapy, using fluorinated pyrimidines,\par
the antifol, methotrexate, and the alkylating agent, cytoxan,\par
has been found to be of significant practical value\par
in 10 to 30% of the patients receiving these anticancer\par
drugs.  protracted hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy\par
in patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasms\par
and tumors of the biliary system has resulted in\par
objective tumor response and associated clinical benefit\par
in 60% of the patients treated.  length of survival has\par
been prolonged in patients with advanced metastatic liver\par

this technique of cancer therapy is\par
effective for palliation of many advanced primary\par

because of the easily accessible arteries.\par
however, almost any involved organ\par

of many tumors can be obtained with\par
present day chemotherapeutic agents\par
for 1 or 2 mth.  the best therapeutic results\par
have been in patients with head and neck\par
and pelvic tumors.  currently infusion techniques\par

celiac axis in 12 patients.  no significant differences\par
in results were observed in the\par
2 groups.  of the 10 patients who received cancer\par
chemotherapy via the hepatic artery,\par
one remains alive 2 mth. after treatment;\par
3 died in the immediate posttreatment\par
period; 7 survived from 1-17 mths after\par
treatment, an average survival of\par
6.1 mth.  all 12 patients who were treated by\par
the intra-aortic administration of cancer\par
chemotherapy have died; 3 patients died\par
in the immediate posttreatment period; the\par
survival time of the remaining 9 averaged\par
3.7 mth.  an objective significant shrinkage\par
of the metastases in the liver was\par
observed in 6 patients (3 treated by the intra-hepatic\par
artery route and 3 via the aorta);\par
this lasted from 1-10 mth.  subjective palliation\par
was observed in 12 patients (5\par
treated by the intrahepatic artery route and 7\par
by the intra-aortic route).  the major\par
complication noted was leukopenia; to a lesser\par
degree, hepatic failure.  in those patients\par
with poor metabolic reserve and in\par
those who had received chemotherapy,\par

courses of intra-arterial cancer chemotherapy.\par

objective response was obtained in\par
57% of the patients treated.  the best results\par

chemotherapy may be of benefit in\par
the palliation of patients in whom other more\par
conventional methods have failed or\par
are contraindicated.  the frequency of serious\par
complications suggests that at present\par

21.3%.  a total of 39 patients\par
received irradiation after questionable radical\par

were common.  twenty-eight of the\par
107 patients died during the postoperative\par
period.  fifty-nine of the 79 surviving\par
patients are known to have died, mostly\par
as a result of recurrent, uncontrollable carcinoma.\par
the procedure was considered\par
palliative in 39 patients.  in 12 of these patients\par
the lesion was removed and the conduit\par
established in one stage; 2 patients died.\par
in only 1 of the surviving 10 patients\par
was the tumor under control.  the average term\par
of survival was 8.5 mth.  the procedure\par
was carried out in 2 stages in 4 cases;\par
2 patients died after the 2nd stage.\par
the 2 surviving patients lived 1.5 and 4 3/4 mth.,\par

benefited from treatment for varying\par
periods of time, but the remaining 30\par
showed no response.  eight patients died\par
during or immediately after treatment; all\par
had advanced cancers of the head-and-neck\par
region.  the mean total dose of methotrexate\par
given in the patients with no response\par
was significantly less than in those\par

of disease, histology of the tumor, or\par

one because of the type of patient referred\par
to the medical oncology service, and\par
it demonstrates that almost 2/3 of the patients\par
died within 2 yr. of diagnosis.  all\par
patients received active, aggressive anti-tumor\par
as well as supportive therapy, although\par
there was no formal protocol for patient\par
management.  it might be possible, employing\par
a standardized therapeutic approach-irradiation\par
when indicated to the entire\par
abdomen in the dose range of 3,500\par
rads, followed by judicious use of currently\par
available anticancer drugs when the\par
disease recurs-to produce a modest increase\par
in the 2-year survival figures.  since\par
most series show that approximately 75%\par
of patients with ovarian carcinoma are in\par
stage iii of iv when first diagnosed, more\par
attention might be directed to earlier\par
diagnosis.  while it is an important field for\par
investigation, methods of facilitating\par
early diagnosis are not apparent at the moment.\par
controlled trials of adjuvant therapy\par
for stage i and ii disease in which approximately\par
40% of recurrences are seen\par

systemic chemotherapy during or immediately\par
after operation, or infusion of drugs\par

correctable cases and 124 which were\par

he performed successfully a hepatico-duodenostomy\par
in a 7-week-old girl.  four\par
years later the girl had developed normally\par
and she was absolutely without symptoms\par
and signs.  the author, discussing the\par
differential diagnostic problems, stresses\par
the diagnostic value of the gradually increasing\par
direct serum bilirubin, proposing\par
the term 'ex juvantibus differentiation' alluding\par
to the differential diagnostic evaluation\par
of the time which passes until the surgical\par
exploration; he also emphasizes the\par
need of early-latest up to the age of 8 weeks\par
performed-surgical exploration.\par
according to him the administration of vit. k\par

level on the 3rd day of life.  hereafter a gradual\par
decrease can be shown.  the suggestion\par

of the newborn.\par
administration of naturally occurring steroids\par

the bilirubin level of these newborns.\par
administration of the same steroids\par
or of progesterone to nursing mothers\par
results in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.\par
these facts explain the pathogenesis\par
of neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of the\par
experimental and clinical findings leads\par
to the conclusion that the high amount of\par
steroid hormones which must be excreted\par
during the neonatal period in conjunction\par
with the relative insufficiency of the neonatal\par
liver is responsible for the inability\par
to conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.\par
the steroid hormones probably compete\par
with bilirubin for the enzyme and substrate\par
necessary for conjugation.  the functional\par
capacity of the neonatal liver is\par
not high enough to conjugate both bilirubin\par
and steroids.  only after excretion of the\par
placental steroids does sufficient conjugation\par
of bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,\par
pregnanediol appears to inhibit the\par

hormones in the pathogenesis of neonatal\par
jaundice and their importance as an\par
aggravating factor in the development of\par
jaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newly\par

a critical analysis of 57 cases of neonatal\par

by study of liver biopsy.  the very\par
low percentage of surgically correctable lesions\par
among patients with neonatal obstructive\par
jaundice and the seriousness and\par
high mortality of the cases of hepatitis\par
treated with a hazardous operation are stressed.\par

clinical study and histological study of the liver in hepatitis in\par
infants.  i.  classification and findings of clinical study and\par
histological study of the liver in hepatitis in infants (japanese).\par
clinical observations and histological studies\par
by liver biopsy on hepatitis in infancy,\par
i. e. obstructive jaundice of unknown cause in\par
infants, were made.  histologically,\par
hepatitis in infancy was divisible into 3 types:\par
(1) no giant cell formation was observed.\par
in general, slight degeneration of liver\par
cells, necrosis and inflammatory\par
changes with stasis of bile were characteristic.\par
(2) the so-called giant cell hepatitis\par
was characteristic.  (3) specific type, presenting\par
the picture of cholangiolitis.\par
histological changes in the liver other than biliary\par
stasis were scanty.  no specific\par
changes which could clinically differentiate the\par
3 types were found.  in each type,\par
serum bilirubin, sgot and sgpt activities had\par
slight characteristic points in clinical\par
and laboratory studies.  in type 1, the values\par
were relatively low, while in type\par
2 they were markedly high.  in type 3, sgot activity\par
was within normal range.  histological\par
characteristics of the liver of type 1\par
were necrosis of liver cells, formation\par
of acidophilic granules and balloon cells,\par
cellular infiltration in glisson's capsule,\par
and biliary stasis in the liver cells and\par
fine bile ducts.  morphologically, findings\par
of viral hepatitis were observed.  in type\par
2 liver tissue was replaced by many\par
multinuclear giant cells.  extreme distortion\par
of cords of liver cells and cellular infiltration\par
in glisson's capsule and lobules were\par
noted.  there was marked biliary\par
stasis in the capillary bile ducts and liver cells.\par
it was characteristic that proliferation\par
of bile ducts and bile plugs were not found,\par
which was consistent with giant\par
cell hepatitis of craing-landing.  in type 3, degeneration\par
of liver cells, necrosis\par
and inflammatory changes were slight.  biliary\par
stasis in the hepatic lobules was conspicuous.\par
histological findings similar to cholangiolitic\par
hepatitis due to drug poisoning\par
were observed.\par

the pathology of 'giant cell hepatitis' in early infancy.\par
a 1-month-old male infant was admitted to\par
hospital because of acute cardiac and\par
circulatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodular\par
liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly,\par
left ventricular dilatation of the heart,\par
hydrothorax, and ascites.  histology\par
of the liver showed a giant cell hepatitis.  the\par
portal areas were widened, with foci\par
of erythropoiesis and histiocytic infiltrations.\par
the liver cells showed vacuolar and\par
degenerative changes.  the giant cells, present\par
in the margin of the regeneration\par
areas, as well as in the degenerated lobules\par
has irregular borders and varied in\par
size from 45-60 ft.  their nuclei were large,\par
sometimes bizarre.  their basophile\par
cytoplasm showed granules of iron pigment\par
which was also found in some normal\par
hepatic cells, in the prominent kupffer cells\par
and in the connective tissue.  in the\par
spleen there were proliferation of connective\par
tissue and scattered areas of erythropoiesis,\par
as well as pigment deposits in the pulpa.\par
iron pigment was also found in the\par
pancreas and salivary glands.  the islets of\par
langerhans were hyperplastic.  the etiology\par
of giant cell hepatitis is still unknown.\par
its pathogenesis may be due to a malformation,\par
immunologic response to some type\par
of antibody, inborn errors of iron\par
metabolism and viral infection.  it is suggested\par
that the giant cell transformation is\par
a response of the immature liver cell to a variety\par
of stimuli.  this case is of interest\par
for the predominance of giant cells with 1 or\par
2 nuclei, presumably it is an intermediate\par
stage or a variant of hepatitis.\par

mothers.  four of the infants developed\par

in these women is unidentified.  the fact\par
that the inhibitor occurs in pregnancy\par
serum suggests that it is probably a progestational\par

neonatal hepatitis: liver biopsy findings and clinical features.\par
on 22 infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal\par
hepatitis, histologic examination\par
of the liver was made by needle biopsy and\par
its relation to the clinical course was\par
investigated.  histologic findings were classified\par
provisionally into 3 types: type i\par
showed no giant cells but only slight damage\par
to hepatic cells with prominent intracellular\par
cholestasis; type ii was characterized\par
by occurrence of numerous giant\par
cells; the specific type was characterized by\par
centrolobular cholestasis without inflammatory\par
reaction.  laboratory examinations\par
revealed that increases in serum\par
transaminases and bilirubin were greater in\par
type ii than in type i, and in the specific\par
type there was no increase in serum transaminase\par
but there was a direct hyperbilirubinemia.\par
as to histologic sequelae,\par
the results of serial biopsy revealed that\par
in type i hepatic damage healed almost completely,\par
and that in type ii giant cells\par
disappeared within 1 yr and, in some cases,\par
hepatic cirrhosis resulted.  the prognosis\par
of neonatal hepatitis may be said to\par
be good in type i, poor in type ii, and\par
undetermined in the specific type.\par

neonatal hepatitis or familial neonatal obstructive jaundice?.\par
four siblings all of whom were boys with\par
chronic obstructive jaundice are described.\par
the onset of the jaundice varied from 1 day\par
to 4 weeks after birth.  two other boys\par
and 2 girls in the same family are healthy.\par
although in one of the 4 cases pathological\par
findings were the same as in neonatal hepatitis\par
('giant cell hepatitis'), other possibilities\par
could not be excluded.  what has been\par
described hitherto as giant cell hepatitis\par
appears to be only a morphological picture,\par
for which there must be several causes.\par
it is concluded from the findings in the 4 patients\par
that one of the possible causes of\par
so-called giant cell hepatitis is an inborn\par
error of metabolism.\par

hypoplasia of the intrahepatic bile ducts.\par
a description of 2 cases: (1) a boy of 13 days\par
old had atresia of the small intestine\par
and pneumonia, and a slightly enlarged liver\par
with faint green coloration.  histological\par
examination revealed numerous collapsed\par
bile ducts which had solid ductular\par
cell sprouts reaching the liver cells;\par
the minor and smallest bile ducts were\par
empty.  (2) a girl of 1 yr and 4 mth had increasing\par
jaundice since birth.  autopsy\par
revealed a hypoplastic common bile duct,\par
which was, however, open to probing,\par
and marked green coloration of the liver.\par
also in this case, the bile ducts were\par
very narrow and had solid ductular cell sprouts\par
reaching the liver cells.  this\par
type of bile duct corresponds to a stage in\par
ontogenesis and does not show signs\par
of proliferation.  it may be considered a form\par
of hypoplasia, as the size and number\par
of the primordial bile ducts is reduced.  when\par
present the anlage shows a regular\par
connection with the liver cells.  this hypoplasia\par
is to be distinguished from an\par
atresia.  the long survival of the second case\par
can be explained by the great\par
compensatory capacity of the liver.\par
.I 1017\par

fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences.\par
the author reports on 18 fatal cases observed\par
in infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old.\par
in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birth\par
or during the first days of life, and\par
was persistent.  the stools were sometimes\par
discolored.  there was no blood incompatibility.\par
the picture was similar to that\par
of congenital biliary atresia.  pathological\par
study revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathological\par
changes of hepatitis (11 cases).\par
the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric.  microscopy\par
shows dissociation of the cell\par
cords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells\par
(necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant cell\par
transformation).  some of the giant cells show\par
vacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids and\par
acidophilic material in their cytoplasm.  there\par
are signs of regeneration, collapse\par
of the stromal framework, proliferation of the\par
mesenchymal cells and bile retention.\par
cells of the erythrocytic series are scattered\par
in the periportal spaces with eosinophilic\par
leucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes.\par
(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7\par
cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodular\par
or granular surface.  the extra-hepatic\par
biliary tree is normal.  the spleen is\par
enlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis,\par
pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferation\par
of bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobular\par
and intralobular fibrous tissue is increased,\par
and shows cellular infiltrations.\par
the architecture of the liver is disturbed by\par
the presence of pseudolobuli in the regeneration\par
areas.  it is suggested that these cases\par
are due to a congenital viral hepatitis,\par
which is not only the result of an intrauterine\par
infection, but also a feature of\par
fetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangiolitic\par
or post-necrotic liver cirrhosis.\par
the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be considered\par
as the result of a cytotoxic action\par
of the virus.  the author considers also\par
the possibility of a viral etiology in\par
cases of biliary atresia on the basis of their\par
morphological similarity with congenital\par
viral hepatitis.\par

metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructive\par
jaundice.\par
   bile duct ligation was carried out in a series of\par
rhesus monkeys.  the time required for the serum bilirubin\par
to stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level,\par
and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closely\par
that seen clinically.  after the serum bilirubin levels\par
had stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached,\par
radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v.  the radioisotope was\par
distributed principally extravascularly and not in the same\par
ratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice.  daily turnover\par
of bilirubin was found to be double that anticipated\par
from normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubin\par
production in obstructive jaundice.  in animals followed for\par
2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in the\par
urine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidney\par
takes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubin\par
excretion.\par

major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management.\par
three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh which\par
required surgical amputation and one\par
case of open pericardial drainage for cardiac\par
tamponade are briefly reported in severe\par
hemophiliacs.  in the first case hemostasis, following\par
amputation, was produced, but the\par
patient died of septicemia secondary to proximally\par
infected tissues; the level of amputation\par
should, therefore, be proximal to all grossly\par
infected tissues.  in the second case, with\par
infected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh,\par
5 separate operative procedures were\par
performed.  the last procedure was elective revision\par
of skin flaps at the hip disarticulation\par
site.  here application of the knowledge gained\par
from previous experience resulted in a completely\par
uncomplicated postoperative course by\par
dint of timing of the surgical procedure\par
in relation to control of infection, loss of plasma\par
fastness, and the judicious use of antibiotic\par
and direct-current electrocoagulation therapy.\par
a plea is made to avoid the use\par
of plasma and ahg therapy in hemophilias\par
for trivial reasons and to consider patients\par
for surgical procedures early in the course of their\par
complications, which demand surgery,\par
at a time when the patient is still responsive\par
to hematologic therapy and prior to the\par
onset of infection in areas of hematoma.  it is\par
felt that a second significant hemorrhage\par
in any particular site constitutes a bona fide\par
indication for surgical intervention, long\par
before the time when surgery is considered as\par
the last resort by the physician, patient and\par
family.  although the authors believe that surgery\par
in the hemophiliac is not to be taken\par
lightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilistic\par
attitude that has resulted in temporizing\par
delays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.\par

immunological demonstration of factor viii protein in the plasma of\par
hemophiliacs and its value for an insight into hemophilia a.\par
by immunization of rabbits one obtains antisera\par
against human factor viii, the action\par
of the immunsera has been determined using\par
a modification of the thromboplastingenerations\par
test (the factor viii neutralization\par
test).  the antibodies against factor viii\par
are equally absorbed by either normal or hemophilia\par
a plasma.  this observation shows\par
that hemophilia a plasma contains as much factor\par
viii protein as normal plasma does.\par
in normal and hemophilia a serum one finds\par
at a lower level similar concentrations of\par
factor viii.  in analogy with cross-reacting substances\par
(crm) in bacteria mutants an\par
hypothesis has been made according to which\par
the authors are dealing with the product\par
of a genetically altered synthesis of factor\par
viii.  this product is functionally less active\par
but possesses the same antigenic determinants\par
as the normal factor viii.  some inhibitor\par
properties of the hemophilia plasma can be\par
explained by competitive inhibition made\par
possible by the similarity of structure.  the fact\par
that the inhibitor discovered by mammen\par
and factor viii have similar properties support\par
the hypothesis.  the theory of some\par
authors according to which the plasma of an\par
hemophiliac a contains normal amounts\par
of a normal factor viii blocked by a specific\par
inhibitor, the pathogenetic agent of hemophilia a\par
is rejected because of genetic considerations\par
and because the accelerator appearing\par
after ether treatment of hemophilia a plasma is\par
not identical with factor viii.\par

localization.  the third, in a haemophiliac b, is\par
very extensive and is accompanied by very\par
marked clinical symptoms of tumour.  there is\par
an extensive femoral gap with a subjacent\par
image of osseous infarction and a progressive\par
turgid tumour of the iliac wing of the\par

with eaca, steroids, and factor\par

marked hypoproteinemia developed\par
by the 94th day of bleeding.  a protein-losing\par
enteropathy was suspected on the basis\par

some bone lesions in the course of blood diseases with special reference\par

a consideration of the genesis of bony callus,\par

such as solitary myeloma, polyosteotic\par
plasmocytoma, waldenstroem's syndrome,\par
the coagulopathic syndrome\par
from a structural defect of the fibrin coagulum,\par
and hemophilia.  fractures in patients\par
with blood diseases are characterized\par
by an abnormal course, and, for an\par
effecient cure, it is necessary to make an\par
accurate diagnosis with regard to the\par
pre-existing blood diseases and to re-establish\par
hemostasis when this has been\par
changed, to prevent hemorrhages, and to correct\par
any plasma defect that may be\par
present and which are reflected in the formation\par

studies of the antihemophilic factor (ahf, factor viii) produced in von\par
willebrand's disease.\par
it has been confirmed that persons with autosomal\par
ahf deficiency (von willebrand's\par
disease) produce large quantities of\par
ahf when transfused with ahf-deficient\par
plasma from persons with hemophilia\par
a.  this occurs despite the fact that\par
'complementation' does not occur in vitro.  one\par
prediction from a model suggesting\par
that the x-locus for ahf is structural while\par
the autosomal locus is regulatory is\par
that the ahf which appears in von willebrand's\par
disease after transfusion will be\par
structurally normal.  the ahf obtained under\par
these conditions has been tested by\par
methods and the results fulfil the prediction.\par
this may imply that the model is\par
correct.  on the other hand, the prediction may\par
have been fulfilled for other\par
reasons.  perhaps the wrong parameters were\par
examined, or the large standard\par
errors of the tests masked a real difference.\par
further tests are obviously needed\par
before one can feel reasonably certain that\par
mutation of a regulatory gene is the\par
basis of von willebrand's disease.  an examination\par
of persons with sex-linked and\par
autosomal ahf deficiency using an antibody\par
prepared against wild type ahf might\par
be very illuminating.  also, transfusion studies\par
should be carried out on persons\par
homozygous for von willebrand's disease if\par
such persons can be found.  failure\par
to obtain 'new synthesis' in a homozygote would\par
throw great doubt on a model which\par
implies that the reduced ahf levels in von\par
willebrand's disease heterozygotes is\par
due entirely to reduction in an effector substance\par
which neutralizes the repressor\par
of an x-chromosome operon directly coding\par

of fraction i therapy was evaluated in major surgery\par
of 6 severely deficient and 4 moderately deficient hemophiliacs.\par
an analysis of clinical results was made, combining\par
the 12 operations of the series with the 116 major\par
operative procedures on hemophiliacs recorded in the\par
english literature, in which fraction i was the sole or\par
major source of factor viii therapy.  dental and nondental\par

special problem of blood cysts.  although the over-all\par
mortality rate following major surgery in hemophiliacs\par
is presently only 5 to 10% using factor viii concentrates,\par
problems still remain.  these include the continued high\par
incidence of abnormal postoperative hemorrhage, the\par

cirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote in\par
thrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activity\par
in the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)\par
after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduce\par
blood losses following prostatectomy, especially if the\par
treatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopically\par
clear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,\par
prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumatic\par
injury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia and\par
other coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.\par
(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effective\par
whether given orally or intravenously.  in states\par
with increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of\par
0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.\par
for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity in\par
the urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day has\par
proved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,\par
nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug on\par
e.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function tests\par
were observed, not even in cases receiving more than\par
1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in\par
46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs of\par
intravascular coagulation in connection with e-aca\par
therapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboembolic\par
complications after prostatectomy in patients\par
treated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.\par
judging from the authors' experience in this material\par
e-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.\par

femoral neuropathy in hemophilia.\par
   six new cases of femoral neuropathy in hemophilic\par
patients are described.  the syndrome begins with severe\par
pain in the groin, in the inferior aspect of the thigh,\par
and deep in the hip region.  this is followed by a pronounced\par
contracture of the hip in flexion and external\par
rotation.  a tender swelling appears in the iliac fossa and\par
groin with a depression in the center corresponding to\par
the inguinal ligament.  finally, a flaccid paralysis of\par
the quadriceps femoris and diminution or absence of sensation\par
in the anteromedial aspect of the thigh and proximal\par
portion of the leg, with a depressed or absent\par
patellar reflex, is discovered.  the authors propose that\par
this syndrome is the result of hemorrhage in the iliopsoas\par
muscle at the musculotendinous junction beneath\par
the iliacus fascia and that the femoral nerve becomes\par
compressed beneath the unyielding inguinal ligament\par
superiorly and the iliopectineal ligament medially.\par
treatment consists in bed rest, analgesics, and freshfrozen\par
plasma during the acute phase.  during the convalescent\par
phase, a hessing long brace is used to protect\par
the knee from hemarthrosis until functional return\par
of the quadriceps femoris has occurred.  to date, the\par
validity of the theory that the femoral-nerve palsy is\par
the result of iliopsoas hemorrhage at the musculotendinous\par
junction and compression of the femoral nerve beneath\par
the inguinal ligament has not been verified.  the\par
authors anticipate some day seeing a non-hemophilic patient\par
with a traumatic iliacus hemorrhage and femoral\par
neuropathy.  should such an opportunity present itself,\par
exploration beneath poupart's ligament may show the\par
femoral nerve to be compressed and thus confirm the\par
proposed cause of the clinical picture.\par

.W\par
hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia: a 5-year prospective study.\par
   medicosocial studies of hemophilia are of\par
particular clinical importance in allowing an assessment\par
of the likely course of the disease at different\par
ages and for differing grades of severity, and in\par
providing knowledge of which complications cause\par
the most disability, loss of education, and earning\par
capacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinical\par
impression of the disease which arises from the\par
recurrent admission of the same few severely affected\par
hemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individual\par
variation in the number and severity of complications\par
in different hemophiliacs an accurate individual\par
prognosis can never be given.  in general,\par
however, the number of spontaneous episodes per\par
year decreases with age, while the severity of individual\par
episodes tends to increase, at least until\par
the age of 21 yr.  there is general agreement that\par
the bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are due\par
to hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathy\par
involves the knee more than it does any other joint.\par
the increased time spent in hospital per episode in\par
later life is in part at least due to the development\par
of relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due to\par
hemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy.\par
thus the correct management of individual\par
hemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance,\par
and at the present time too little is known\par
of the best possible treatment for these episodes.\par
little is known of the pathological mechanisms of\par
hemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presence\par
of blood or its presence under tension which\par
leads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerning\par
the routine admission of all hemarthroses\par
to hospital regardless of severity and also about the\par
advisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoid\par
the development of destructive arthropathy.  because\par
of the individual variation between patients, the\par
changes in the pattern of the disease with age, and\par
the difficulty of obtaining suitable control patients\par
these questions can be answered only by further\par
longterm prospective medicosocial studies.\par
